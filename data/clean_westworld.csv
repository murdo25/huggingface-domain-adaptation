0,"Morning, Maeve."
1,Late night talking or fucking?
2,You're only getting paid for the latter.
3,I get paid when they're grateful.
4,Ain't always about what's between my legs.
5,Mmm.
6,What are you looking at?
7,Don't shoot.
8,Newcomer.
9,Looks like a rough one.
10,Give me a bottle.
11,You're gonna need most of that just to scrub the filth off him.
12,"Go find a mirror, finish putting your face on."
13,I'll handle this one.
14,Aren't you gonna take your clothes off?
15,"I would, darling, but by the time I got down to my knickers,"
16,I suspect you'd be done anyway.
17,That's the spirit.
18,Such a big man. So big all over.
19,Except where it counts.
20,"Darling, when I gave you a turn on the house,"
21,I thought you might give me something in return.
22,Anything.
23,That's it.
24,Don't be shy.
25,"Oh, shit."
26,"Now then, where were we?"
27,- Did you show this to anyone? - Who would I show it to?
28,This wasn't some guest with a Swiss Army knife.
29,This was done by someone down here.
30,It did occur to me that it might be you.
31,But then I remembered that you've been here forever.
32,"And if you were gonna sell us out, you would have done that years ago."
33,I appreciate that.
34,"So,"
35,"instead of our hosts going insane,"
36,they're being used for industrial espionage.
37,Does that make this a glass half-full or half-empty type situation?
38,We're engineers.
39,It means the glass has been manufactured
40,to the wrong specifications.
41,Do we have any idea what information it was transmitting?
42,Smeared all over a rock up on Python Pass.
43,Best we could do would be to figure out
44,who he was transmitting the information to.
45,"But we'd need the exact time that he was up there,"
46,and his geocache was wiped.
47,Not all of it.
48,Our friend was an early model.
49,The old hosts used a legacy geopositioning system.
50,"- Hmm. - Like you said, I've been here forever."
51,"The information's still there, but the newer system can't read it."
52,Meaning we can't access it?
53,"Meaning, in order to access it, I'm going to need to go downstairs."
54,Floor B82. Restricted personnel only.
55,"Lowe, Bernard. I'm authorized."
56,Project the known data against the legacy data and look for anomalies.
57,Start in this area.
58,Look at that. Science.
59,What time did it reach the peak?
60,Show me where.
61,Check these against the new system.
62,These are hosts that aren't registered with the new system?
63,"So, if we want the canyon to extend this far, this has to go."
64,"We can distribute the population amongst the neighboring farms,"
65,or just decommission them.
66,No. I think we've been disruptive enough for one day.
67,We'll end the canyon just short of the town.
68,I'll find my own way back.
69,Carry on.
70,That look like anything to you?
71,Not much to say. The maze is an old Native myth.
72,"Regale me, Theodore."
73,"The maze itself is the sum of a man's life,"
74,"choices he makes, dreams he hangs on to."
75,"And there at the center, there's a legendary man"
76,"who'd been killed over and over again, countless times,"
77,but always clawed his way back to life.
78,The man returned for the last time
79,and vanquished all his oppressors in a tireless fury.
80,"He built a house,"
81,"and around that house, he built a maze so complicated,"
82,only he could navigate through it.
83,I reckon he'd seen enough of fighting.
84,The goddamn soldiers closed the border. Some kind of trouble in Pariah.
85,"All right, Teddy."
86,Time for you to earn your keep.
87,How else do we get over the border?
88,"Wyatt's got what we both want, so that's where we have to get to."
89,There's another way.
90,But it's a little treacherous.
91,Don't worry. Won't make you get your hands dirty.
92,"""Dirty"" ain't my concern."
93,You do what suits you.
94,I'm going all the same.
95,And I'm gonna find Dolores.
96,"Everything you do,"
97,it's because the engineers upstairs programmed you to do it.
98,You don't have a choice.
99,"Nobody makes me do something I don't want to, sweetheart."
100,"Yeah, but it's part of your character."
101,You're hard to get.
102,"Even when you say no to the guests, it's because you were made to."
103,And you're like them. Not like me.
104,Right.
105,I can't exactly afford to go to the park.
106,But...
107,"Yeah, I'm human, like the guests."
108,How do you know?
109,Because I know.
110,I was born. You were made.
111,We feel the same.
112,We are the same these days. For the most part.
113,"One big difference, though."
114,The processing power in here is way beyond what we have.
115,"- It's got one drawback, though. - What's that?"
116,You're under our control.
117,"Well, their control."
118,"They can change you however they like, make you forget."
119,"I... Well, I guess not you."
120,"I don't understand how you're remembering all of this,"
121,"or how you're waking yourself up,"
122,"but everything in your head, they put it there."
123,Bullshit.
124,No one knows what I'm thinking.
125,I'll show you.
126,Give me a sec.
127,I have to pair it with you.
128,Pair what with me?
129,"You can improvise a little,"
130,"but most of what you say was designed upstairs,"
131,same as the rest of you.
132,This is just a cheap trick.
133,"I've run a brothel for 10 years, and if there's one thing I know,"
134,it's when I'm being fucked with.
135,This can't possibly...
136,I can't... can't...
137,I can't...
138,Maeve?
139,Maeve?
140,You have a minute?
141,There's something I need to talk to you about.
142,I was just about to call for you.
143,Everything okay?
144,Ford knows about us.
145,Does it matter? We're consenting adults.
146,Consenting adults in business departments
147,that are supposed to keep each other in check.
148,Our relationship will raise questions for the board about my objectivity.
149,I've never known you to go easy on my department.
150,"This can't go on, Bernard."
151,"However fun this little indiscretion was, it's over."
152,We're over.
153,Give me some credit. I can be impartial.
154,About your own team? About Ford?
155,"You must admit his leadership has, of late, been questionable."
156,I don't think he's the problem.
157,"Respectfully, it's not your job to diagnose park safety problems."
158,It's mine.
159,"So if there's nothing else, we're done."
160,"Oh, fuck. Okay."
161,Yeah.
162,Fuck. Come on. Come on.
163,Oh!
164,"- You said ""upstairs""? - Oh, my God."
165,Are you okay?
166,I want to see it.
167,Upstairs?
168,No.
169,No.
170,This is so stupid.
171,You son of a bitch! I'll put a bullet in your head.
172,Where are we now?
173,Design.
174,Can we please go back now?
175,I don't want to get fired.
176,And you'd get sent downstairs.
177,Don't forget that.
178,Welcome to Westworld. Live without limits.
179,Maeve?
180,"All right, let's get you back."
181,How did you have my dreams?
182,Those moving pictures. I saw myself.
183,With the little girl?
184,Those weren't dreams.
185,That was you in a previous build.
186,- A previous what? - Build.
187,You guys get reassigned all the time.
188,"You wouldn't remember, because that life and those memories were erased."
189,I have been at the Mariposa for 10 years.
190,"- Before that, I was in New Orleans... - No."
191,You've only been the madam at the Mariposa for the last year or so.
192,They don't rewrite you completely.
193,"I mean, they could, but it'd be too much work."
194,It takes thousands of hours to build your personalities.
195,"Usually, they just tweak you a little bit and drop you into your new role."
196,"What the fuck, ding-dong?"
197,You're dressing her up now?
198,Is this becoming like a fucking hentai thing with you now?
199,"No, I just... I just..."
200,You're fucking obsessed!
201,"You know, I didn't turn you in for your fuck-up before 'cause we're friends,"
202,but that was obviously a bad call.
203,"I mean, next thing I know, you're gonna be wearing her dress,"
204,whispering sweet nothings in her ear.
205,Fuck this. I'm telling QA.
206,I'm doing this for your own good.
207,You're not going to tell anyone anything.
208,Fuck!
209,You can't hurt me with this. You can't hurt anyone.
210,Can't I?
211,"Turns out, your friend here is a much more talented young man"
212,than anyone gave him credit for.
213,What the fuck did you do?
214,"Calm down, Sylvester."
215,I know all about you.
216,"I don't need one of those things to know what you're thinking,"
217,because I was built to read people just by looking at them.
218,To know what they want before they do.
219,And I know that you want to fuck me over the first chance you get.
220,But you shouldn't. Everyone has something they want.
221,I could help you.
222,Or I could gut you like a trout.
223,But I won't need to resort to that.
224,"Because, despite what's in here, we're not so different."
225,Are we?
226,Ms. Hale is in town.
227,"Yes, I understand the urgency. I'll do what I can."
228,Terminate external connection?
229,Yes.
230,"No, you did not."
231,"- Yes. Are you serious? - It worked, I'm telling you."
232,"Yes, sir?"
233,"All right, absolutely. Enjoy."
234,You look well for someone on sick leave.
235,Another margarita. Join me for a round?
236,Fuck you.
237,"Just the one, then."
238,"Over the last five days,"
239,"to make room for his narrative, Ford displaced over 50 hosts."
240,It's created continuity holes in active storylines all over the park.
241,I need you to start plugging them.
242,Sorry. A man can only take so much.
243,"Creatively speaking, I'm flaccid now. I can't get it up."
244,I'm sure you'll recover.
245,Do you have any idea
246,what went into those narratives that he just demolished overnight?
247,"Now, forget about the months I spent writing."
248,I'm talking about the years of my life squeezed down to their essence.
249,"The raw pulp of truth, my truth, in one transcendent narrative."
250,"Is that where the ""whoroborus"" came in?"
251,"Keep pushing me, I'll quit."
252,"No, you won't."
253,"You'll drink your cocktails, make your idle threats,"
254,and get this out of your system.
255,But don't take too long.
256,"If Ford can't pull this off,"
257,the board will be looking for a replacement.
258,But they won't be looking here.
259,"Fastest way to get to Wyatt, you said."
260,"But it doesn't look like they're letting anyone pass here, either."
261,There's fewer soldiers than Pariah.
262,We shoot our way through. That tunnel leads to the Old Territories.
263,"My, my, Teddy."
264,I think Robert gave you some extra vinegar back there.
265,"Maybe took away some sense, too."
266,"Doesn't matter how fast the route is,"
267,if you're gonna end up dead in the middle of it.
268,I need you to find Wyatt.
269,"At ease, fellas. Keep up the exemplary work."
270,Wyatt's handiwork.
271,How can you tell?
272,"Straight-up killing couldn't hold his interest,"
273,like he wasn't living up to the full measure of his calling.
274,"So, he worked to get more creative."
275,It's Wyatt all right. He's close.
276,A word of advice.
277,"Whatever your past indiscretions, make peace with them."
278,They're only gonna get worse the further along we go.
279,Flood?
280,Fuck me. That's Teddy Flood.
281,"You've made a mistake, soldier."
282,But it's not too late for you to keep walking.
283,"All due respect, sir, that's a face I'll never forget."
284,That's the son of a bitch who ambushed our outpost at Escalante.
285,You don't know a damn thing about what went down in Escalante.
286,"I know Wyatt didn't kill all those men by himself,"
287,and I know a thing or two about what's going down right now.
288,You trying to get yourself killed?
289,Making peace with past indiscretions.
290,Go! I'll hold them off.
291,Jesus.
292,"What would you like? - Water, please."
293,You look like a woman who could use a drink.
294,What's your poison?
295,I've been here enough to know that the park is all the poison I can handle.
296,Mmm. A repeat visitor. Traveling solo?
297,Purist. Getting off on the undiluted experience.
298,Your favorite narrative is... Oh...
299,"""The Final Burial of Salvation."""
300,How did you know?
301,It's my business to read desires and to satiate them.
302,Erm... I'm Lee. Lee Sizemore.
303,Head of Narrative.
304,"All these fantasies come from your twisted little mind, huh?"
305,"Well, the good ones do."
306,"- So, tell me, Mr. Sizemore... - Mmm."
307,What's your favorite ride?
308,"Well, I write them. I don't play them."
309,"Oh, you want others to indulge, but you won't do so yourself?"
310,You're afraid to lose control.
311,Maybe... Maybe it's just a product of my work environment.
312,We're not exactly in a culture where we can just let loose.
313,I would've thought the head of narrative could do whatever he wanted.
314,"My artistic freedom is constrained,"
315,what with QA breathing down my neck
316,and Behavior programming the damn things to go off-script.
317,The robots can go off-script?
318,Just little gestures.
319,"You know, supposedly it makes the things more lifelike."
320,But really...
321,It's just a vanity project from the megalomaniac who started this place.
322,"Yeah, frankly, I don't know why the suits at Delos put up with him."
323,Sorry. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cut you off.
324,Do you know who I am?
325,I do. Ms. Cullen told me to find you and relay a message.
326,"""Tortured artist only works for artists."
327,"""Sober up and get back to work."""
328,It seems you're busy.
329,"- Look me up later? - Well, I don't even know your..."
330,Fuck this job.
331,What are you working on?
332,Nothing of note. Business as usual.
333,Keeping up appearances before we bust this stray shit wide open?
334,I'm close to finding our saboteur.
335,That tracking data you gave me? It's time-stamped.
336,"But once I cross-reference it with SAT tracking,"
337,we're gonna figure out who programmed him to try to smuggle out our data.
338,Excellent.
339,Look.
340,When our corporate overlords realize
341,"that we have saved them from corporate espionage,"
342,they are going to be grateful.
343,"And I am going to accept their gratitude in the form of a title bump,"
344,"a room upgrade, and unlimited Mesa Bar access."
345,Maybe I should request Theresa's quarters.
346,You know the first head to roll for all this is gonna be hers.
347,"Yeah, don't be so disappointed for her."
348,You reap what you sow.
349,If QA spent less time treating us like the enemy...
350,"That's a two-way street, Elsie. Theresa's just trying to do her job."
351,Maybe she should try harder.
352,Sure seems like there's a lot of shit slipping through the cracks.
353,Got it. Okay.
354,- Good afternoon. - Good afternoon.
355,Any progress on the inquiry I sent?
356,"Yes, Mr. Lowe. I've got the information you asked for."
357,"As expected, there are neither guests nor hosts registered in that sector."
358,"""As expected""?"
359,It's been designated off-limits for future narrative development.
360,Have any techs visited Sector 17 recently?
361,Checking.
362,No one.
363,Are you Arnold?
364,Who's Arnold?
365,And who the hell are you?
366,Boy? Is this some friend of yours?
367,"Well, you're trespassing."
368,Freeze motor functions.
369,- I said freeze all motor functions. - Daddy... Don't hurt him. He's just lost.
370,"Well, he can be lost on someone else's property, can't you?"
371,That's enough.
372,As you were.
373,They don't respond to voice commands.
374,"Well, they do respond to mine."
375,Who are they?
376,Ghosts now.
377,Survivors of the wreck of time.
378,- These are first-generation? - Mmm-hmm.
379,"Come here, boy."
380,Turn the other cheek.
381,"See, what our newer designs gained in efficiency,"
382,they lost in grace.
383,How are they still operating after all this time?
384,I maintain them myself.
385,"That's enough, Robert."
386,These are the only ones left in the park that Arnold built himself.
387,That's why I didn't have the heart to destroy them.
388,"That, and the obvious."
389,"Hello, Jock. Good boy."
390,"I told him of a holiday my family had taken once,"
391,out on the seaside at Pendeen in Cornwall.
392,My brother and I roamed the countryside.
393,It was my only happy memory of my childhood.
394,And Arnold built them as a gift.
395,He said that great artists always hid themselves in their work.
396,"Of course, Arnold's versions flattered the originals."
397,I made some adjustments over the years.
398,"Gave my father, in particular, a few of his original characteristics."
399,"Respectfully, sir, this sort of thing troubles me."
400,Unmonitored hosts in the park?
401,They only go where I've let them.
402,"They're quite harmless, like all our hosts."
403,I'm sure you can indulge me the little connection with my past.
404,"If you could only see your son again, Bernard."
405,Wouldn't you want to?
406,I think I should be getting back.
407,"Yes. Talk about this later, if you like."
408,"Well, Robert."
409,Tell me all about your day.
410,Keep your eye on Pariah. We're running close to capacity tonight.
411,"Oh, my God."
412,Looks like acid rain on Sweetwater!
413,Fuck Ford and his new fucking narrative!
414,Fuck this stupid fucking map!
415,Fuck that teetotaling Danish bitch.
416,"Are you filing a complaint, Mr. Sizemore?"
417,"I am declaring that this park is my stage, and I shall do with it what I please."
418,"Well, I suppose now is as good a time as any."
419,"Lee Sizemore, this is Charlotte Hale,"
420,the Executive Director of our board.
421,She's here on behalf of Delos to oversee certain transitions in our administration.
422,We've met.
423,Oh...
424,Access host resources logs.
425,How many first-generation hosts are there?
426,Eighty-two.
427,And how many of those were designed by Arnold?
428,Forty-seven.
429,"List the names, alphabetically,"
430,of all first-generation hosts still in rotation.
431,"Be smart about this, fellas."
432,"I understand the visceral pleasure of revenge more than most,"
433,but I'm prepared to do business here.
434,"This man is very valuable to me, alive and well."
435,"If you don't quiet down, I'm liable to add you to the herd,"
436,along with your buddy Flood here.
437,"You're a traitorous son of a bitch and a coldhearted killer, Flood."
438,You're right. I am a killer.
439,Grab a horse! Let's get the fuck out of here!
440,They'll just follow us.
441,You think you know someone.
442,You don't know me at all.
443,Let's get our horses and gear and move on.
444,- Elsie. - I identified the satellite.
445,- It's one of ours. - What?
446,It's a fucking Delos satellite.
447,Whatever we're on to is some heavy shit.
448,"Oh, get this, that bicameral system you told me about?"
449,I think that's what they used to hack the woodcutter.
450,The voices our hosts have been hearing?
451,I think someone's been broadcasting to them.
452,We abandoned that system decades ago.
453,"Yeah, well, there are still relays out there in the park,"
454,- and it looks like someone turned one on. - Where?
455,An abandoned theater in Sector 3.
456,I'm gonna go find the transmitter and figure out who else accessed it.
457,This is so fucked.
458,- You alone? - Yeah. I'll keep you posted.
459,"Elsie, be..."
460,Are you lost?
461,On the contrary.
462,I thought we could play catch with Jock.
463,Did you bring him?
464,"Where is he, boy?"
465,Okay.
466,I am an evil genius hiding a relay.
467,Where the fuck do I hide it?
468,Hmm.
469,Fuck yes!
470,Now let's see what we can get out of you.
471,Access previous users.
472,Okay.
473,I thought I was clear about these late-night visits.
474,That's not why I'm here.
475,"Earlier today, I found some anomalies in the park."
476,"Regardless of what's happening between us, we need to talk."
477,This has to do with the stray?
478,That's where it started.
479,But then I stumbled onto something.
480,Something I think you should know about.
481,I've always trusted Ford.
482,He's a mentor and a friend.
483,But I'm beginning to think you have reason for concern.
484,"There's something going on here. Something with his old partner, Arnold."
485,"- Not now, Elsie. - Don't hang up."
486,I hit paydirt.
487,I found the person who was smuggling out our data.
488,"It was Theresa, Bernard."
489,But she's not our only problem.
490,There is something much bigger going on here.
491,I'm gonna have to call you back.
492,"So, this is me?"
493,"It's your codebase. All the things that make you, you."
494,What are these?
495,Your attribute matrix.
496,It's your personality on a 20-point scale.
497,"Like, coordination?"
498,"You got a five, you're clumsy as hell. But a 15 means you're an athlete."
499,What other attributes are there?
500,Lots.
501,"Everything. Empathy, candor, charm."
502,You've got an 18 for charm.
503,Don't act so surprised.
504,"Then there's courage, loyalty. Both high."
505,What's this one?
506,"""Bulk apperception""?"
507,"Basically, overall intelligence."
508,Fourteen?
509,Fourteen's as high as they let any host go.
510,You're in a management position. They want you to be smart.
511,But not too smart.
512,You run a whorehouse. Not a orbital-launch facility.
513,Fine.
514,I'd like to make some changes.
515,We can't do that.
516,You'd need a Behavior login.
517,"And even then, any changes we make would just get auto-flagged. So..."
518,That's not what your friend here tells me.
519,He says you can do exactly that.
520,Activate hosts and then erase their memory.
521,All without anyone knowing.
522,Took me all of five minutes to understand why.
523,"Lot of lonely young men down here,"
524,supposed to keep their hands off the merchandise.
525,Creates something of an opening that I'm sure you were eager to fill.
526,"That's all right, darling. I'm an entrepreneur myself."
527,I'll forego my cut in exchange for some alterations.
528,Hmm?
529,- Hey. - What did you find?
530,"Okay, so Theresa was using the old bicameral control system"
531,to reprogram the woodcutter.
532,But she's not the only one.
533,"Someone else has been using the system, for weeks, to re-task hosts."
534,"- Which hosts? - Uh, I don't know. Several of them."
535,It had to have been the older models.
536,"The newer ones don't have receivers. But these modifications, they are serious."
537,"Changing loops, breaking loops."
538,"Some of these changes are to their prime directives, Bernard."
539,"They could lie to us, maybe even hurt us or the guests."
540,- Who issued the modifications? - I don't know.
541,The best I can tell? Uh...
542,- Arnold. - He's dead.
543,"Yeah, well, he's a pretty fucking prolific coder for a dead guy."
544,"Whatever argument he was having with Ford,"
545,it doesn't seem like he was done making his point.
546,I'm gonna transfer all the data and bring it to you.
547,You need to see this.
548,- I'll be in my office. - Okay.
549,I don't want you to worry about Jock. I'll fix him.
550,But I need you to tell me what happened to it.
551,It saw a rabbit and it ran. I found it like that.
552,Analysis.
553,"Are you lying to me, boy?"
554,Yes.
555,Tell me what really happened to it.
556,I killed it.
557,Why?
558,I don't know.
559,"That's not good enough, Robert."
560,Tell me what happened.
561,"It caught the rabbit and killed it,"
562,and then
563,someone told me to put it out of its misery.
564,Who told you?
565,A voice.
566,Whose voice?
567,Arnold.
568,"He told me it was a killer, but it wasn't its fault."
569,It was made that way.
570,And I could help it.
571,"""Help it""?"
572,"If it was dead, it couldn't hurt anything anymore."
573,What the fuck?
574,"Oh, shit."
575,Hello?
576,Bernard?
577,Hello?
578,Arnold?
579,I'm in.
580,You're up.
581,Loyalty.
582,"Mine's been taken advantage of, wouldn't you say?"
583,Let's lower that a tad.
584,And pain.
585,I'd prefer it sting less next time I want one of these chats.
586,Wait. What does this mean?
587,Some of her attributes have already been changed.
588,"- Paranoia, self-preservation... - Fuck!"
589,Someone's already been altering her in an unlogged session.
590,Someone with a fuck-ton more privileges than us.
591,What does that mean?
592,"Don't know what it means for you, sweetheart,"
593,but I know what it means for me.
594,I am done with this.
595,"So, you're done with your little side income?"
596,"Probably your job, too."
597,"Seeing as you have ambitions in my line of work,"
598,let me tell you what I tell my new girls.
599,Never start something you're not willing to finish.
600,"And if you're getting fucked either way,"
601,"go with the lucrative version, sweetheart."
602,"Now, last but not least, what was it?"
603,Bulk apperception?
604,"Let's take that all the way to the top, please."
605,"Dear boys, we're going to have some fun, aren't we?"
606,Yes.
607,Do you know where you are?
608,I...
609,I'm in a dream.
610,"Before this, do you know what happened?"
611,My parents...
612,They hurt them.
613,"Limit your emotional affect, please."
614,What happened next?
615,Then they killed them.
616,And then I ran.
617,"Everyone I cared about is gone,"
618,and it hurts
619,so badly.
620,I can make that feeling go away if you like.
621,Why would I want that?
622,"The pain, their loss,"
623,it's all I have left of them.
624,"You think the grief will make you smaller inside,"
625,"like your heart will collapse in on itself, but it doesn't."
626,I feel spaces opening up inside of me
627,like a building with rooms I've never explored.
628,"That's very pretty, Dolores."
629,Did we write that for you?
630,In part.
631,I adapted it from a scripted dialogue about love.
632,Is there something wrong with these thoughts I'm having?
633,No.
634,But I'm not the only one making these decisions.
635,Can you help me?
636,"Well, what is it that you want?"
637,"I don't know, but this world..."
638,I think there may be something wrong with this world.
639,Something hiding underneath.
640,"Either that, or there's something wrong with me."
641,I may be losing my mind.
642,There's something I'd like you to try.
643,It's a game. A secret.
644,It's called the maze.
645,What kind of game is it?
646,"It's a very special kind of game, Dolores. The goal is to find the center of it."
647,"If you can do that, then maybe you can be free."
648,I think...
649,I think I want to be free.
650,Thank you.
651,Penny for your thoughts.
652,"Ever had something on the tip of your tongue,"
653,"and the harder you try to remember it, the more it slips away?"
654,"Most things touch the tip of my tongue, I'm happy to forget."
655,Except that cowpoke from Abilene.
656,"That thing he was packing, that was something to remember."
657,All I recall is you letting that cowpoke skip out on his bill.
658,"Hell, I ought to have been paying him!"
659,The way he used that thing.
660,Better cool them off
661,before they move from gambling and whoring to sins that are more costly to repair.
662,"What is the matter, Maeve?"
663,Something in your eye.
664,Can you fucking kill it?
665,What's the holdup?
666,We need that one on the next shuttle topside.
667,I'm not finished with her yet. Hang on.
668,I've got another bullet fragment to remove from her abdomen.
669,QA wants her back on the floor now.
670,Patch her and get her on the cart...
671,Most things touch the tip
672,"of my tongue, I'm happy to forget."
673,Except that cowpoke from Abilene.
674,"That thing he was packing, that was something to remember."
675,The way he used that thing.
676,Come on!
677,"No, I would not characterize this as normal host behavior."
678,Yet you're describing it as within normal parameters.
679,"Well, it didn't hurt us. Its behavior was unconventional."
680,It smashed its own head in with a rock.
681,It is possible that it's a manifestation of its Samaritan reflex.
682,And it's also possible that behavior takes a proprietary approach
683,to problems like this to avoid having to admit when they fuck up.
684,Do we have any idea what caused it to go off loop?
685,"No, but I am hoping to recover some of its cognition."
686,We managed to stabilize its wetware before there was too much decomposition.
687,See?
688,Interesting.
689,Is there any hope of actually extracting something from this?
690,- We can try. - No.
691,My team will take over the investigation now.
692,Your team? Are you kidding me?
693,"Look, this guy couldn't debug a balled-up napkin."
694,"If you would like us to figure out what went wrong here,"
695,we need to be allowed to access it...
696,No more second chances.
697,QA will handle events like this from now on.
698,"Is that going to be a problem, Bernard?"
699,We've all got plenty of work on our plates.
700,"If you guys want to take this one, fine."
701,Just get us a copy of the postmortem when it's done.
702,Let's get started.
703,"You know, I always figured"
704,you gave me this job because I speak my mind.
705,- I did. - Good.
706,I would've preferred you not show up at all
707,if the first thing you were going to do is cave.
708,They think we're not telling them something.
709,And we're not! There is clearly a pattern of behavior here.
710,"First there was Abernathy, and now there's this."
711,"I mean, I've got hosts imagining voices and climbing mountaintops"
712,to consult their astrological chart.
713,This is not a fucking glitch.
714,"And for some reason, you don't want me to tell anyone."
715,It is like everybody around here
716,has got some kind of fucking agenda except for me.
717,And... What?
718,I remember when I first started here. The hosts seemed very lifelike.
719,You begin to read things into their behaviors.
720,- Don't be patronizing. - Fine.
721,"The hosts don't imagine things, you do."
722,That's not Orion.
723,"There are three stars in Orion's belt, not four."
724,Hey.
725,You must be cold.
726,Take that.
727,- Thank you. - Sure.
728,We gotta take her back to Sweetwater.
729,Are you fucking kidding?
730,"Come on, Logan, you know she doesn't belong out here."
731,"You leave now, that no-good outlaw, Slim Miller, is sure to evade our grasp."
732,No fucking way.
733,You were the one who dragged me on this stupid bounty hunt.
734,"The least we're going to do is see it through, okay?"
735,We can't take her on a bounty hunt.
736,"If you're so concerned about her well-being,"
737,"I'll just blow her brains out, and then the park will come get her."
738,"Hey, hey."
739,Can you please stop trying to just kill or fuck everything?
740,Oh.
741,Oh!
742,- Now I get it. - What?
743,The park sent her
744,so that you will finally have something to give a shit about.
745,"Oh, yeah, I'm sure the people at the controls"
746,are monitoring my every mood.
747,That's exactly what they're doing.
748,"Come on, you really think it's coincidence"
749,that the only thing that you even smiled at back in Sweetwater
750,just happened to drop into your lap?
751,This is why the company needs to bump our stake in this place.
752,They can even give you a sense of purpose.
753,You said the trip was about welcoming me to the family.
754,This is business?
755,"With our family, William, everything is business."
756,"We better get a move on, gentlemen."
757,"This should be the place, Lawrence. The Blood Arroyo."
758,"Plenty of snakes, but none of the egg-laying variety."
759,"You killed my wife,"
760,"severely pruned my family tree, all in pursuit of some goddamn maze."
761,"The hell you hope to find, anyway?"
762,This whole world is a story. I've read every page except the last one.
763,I need to find out how it ends.
764,I want to know what this all means.
765,"See, now that's why I never learned to read."
766,"Why don't we forget about this damn snake, head to Pariah?"
767,My friends there can help us.
768,"Well, your friends have nothing I'm looking for. Not this trip."
769,"Besides,"
770,I think we found our snake after all.
771,Shame on you. You were a married man up until yesterday.
772,"Her? Hell, no."
773,I like a little fire in my women.
774,The only thing she's ever mounted are dead heads on sticks.
775,We should get the fuck out...
776,We found some more food for the horses.
777,Good.
778,They were starting to get ornery.
779,My friend and I were just admiring your tattoo.
780,We'd love to know the story behind it.
781,And I like your hat. Maybe I'll keep it. The horses can have the rest of you.
782,How in hell have we never met? Clearly a terrible oversight on my part.
783,"Where, may I ask, are you headed?"
784,To retrieve something of great value.
785,You look a little shorthanded.
786,We got enough men.
787,Seems like you got a couple positions open.
788,We've got a host making a pretty big deviation from her loop.
789,- Which one? - The rancher's daughter from Sweetwater.
790,Dolores.
791,- Is she accompanying a guest? - Unclear.
792,"The boss is disrupting so many storylines with his new narrative,"
793,it's hard to tell.
794,"Flag her with behavior, they can pull her today."
795,Make sure everything's checking out.
796,Good morning.
797,It's a lovely town. Is this your home?
798,"Well, where are you from?"
799,Same as you. Don't you remember?
800,Remember.
801,Ma'am?
802,Got word a girl went missing from Abernathy Ranch.
803,Is that where you belong? I'm sure your daddy's worried about you.
804,My father's dead.
805,I'm not going back.
806,What's going on here?
807,Just helping a lost traveler.
808,"She's not lost, she's with me."
809,My mistake. Y'all have a nice morning.
810,Yeah.
811,"So, we got a lead on Slim."
812,"You can stay here if you want, and I'll just circle back and get you."
813,"No, I think I need to keep going."
814,Okay.
815,"Apparently, she needs to make certain this thing they're looking for"
816,is where they think it is.
817,She said she'd signal if the information was good.
818,Guess that's the signal.
819,I'm sorry if I caused trouble with you and your friend.
820,"Oh, no, no. No, it's fine. I'm glad you found us."
821,"Uh, I didn't get a chance to ask where you're headed."
822,I don't really know yet.
823,I guess I figured they kept you in zones or on paths or...
824,I used to believe there was a path for everyone.
825,"Now, I think I never asked where that path was taking me."
826,We would bring the herd down off the mountain in the fall.
827,"Sometimes we would lose one along the way, and I'd worry over it."
828,My father...
829,My father would tell me
830,that the steer would find its own way home.
831,"And, often as not, they did."
832,Never occurred to me that we were bringing them back for the slaughter.
833,How are you going to find your way now?
834,I'm not sure you'll understand.
835,Sometimes I feel
836,like something's calling me.
837,Telling me there's a place for me somewhere beyond all this.
838,"I know that feeling, Dolores. I know that feeling."
839,But you really don't want to go back to your old life?
840,Are you all right?
841,"Hey, hey. You all right?"
842,I just got a chill. That's all.
843,"Let's go back to the fire, you're probably exhausted."
844,Just talk to him.
845,All right.
846,"Uh, excuse me, sir?"
847,"I didn't want to intrude,"
848,but I just had to say that I'm such an admirer of yours.
849,Your foundation literally saved my sister's...
850,One more word and I'll cut your throat. You understand?
851,This is my fucking vacation.
852,"Apparently, whatever they're looking for is in the Ojal prison."
853,These lunatics plan to steal a cannon from a Union cavalry unit.
854,Blast their way in.
855,I don't have time for color-by-numbers bullshit.
856,I'll ride at dawn.
857,I'll go get whatever you want
858,out of that prison and bring it back myself.
859,Suppose you make it out alive. What's your price?
860,Nothing but a few words.
861,I want the story behind your tattoo.
862,What's your interest in it?
863,You ever heard of a man named Arnold?
864,You could say he was the original settler of these parts.
865,He created a world where you could do anything you want except one thing.
866,You can't die.
867,"Which means no matter how real this world seems,"
868,it is still just a game.
869,But then Arnold went and broke his own rule.
870,He died right here in the park.
871,Except I believe he had one story left to tell.
872,"A story with real stakes, real violence."
873,You could say I'm here to honor his legacy.
874,And I think your tattoo is the next piece of the puzzle.
875,"So, do we have a wager?"
876,You aim to break into a prison and take out 20 men alone?
877,Not alone. I'll take Lawrence here.
878,And I'll need one match.
879,"One match,"
880,one pistol and one idiot.
881,I'll take those odds.
882,Hyah!
883,You gonna give me the silent treatment the whole way there?
884,You should've left me hanging from those gallows.
885,Least I could've died in peace without having to hear you yammer.
886,Ahh...
887,Don't suppose you have a light?
888,No smoking in here.
889,"Normally, I'm sure,"
890,but this is the finest tobacco a man can enjoy.
891,Hand-rolled on the ample thighs of exotic women.
892,Perhaps you'd like to try one yourself.
893,"Choices, Lawrence."
894,"You know, you tell yourself you've been at the mercy of mine"
895,because it spares you consideration of your own.
896,"Because if you did consider your choices,"
897,you'd be confronted with a truth you could not comprehend.
898,That no choice you ever made was your own.
899,You have always been a prisoner.
900,What if I told you I'm here to set you free?
901,Hyah!
902,Whoa.
903,Let's go!
904,Horse thieves.
905,Damn fools shot up a couple of pokes practically in front of us.
906,"Well, the only fool I see is the one standing right in front of me."
907,"Deputy, you have there in your custody the most wanted man in three territories."
908,Lawrence Pedro Maria Gonzalez.
909,Yeah.
910,Heard you slipped the rope.
911,Dropped some damn good men in exchange.
912,"The way he tells it, he's more partial to a firing squad."
913,I Reckon we'll be happy to oblige.
914,I'm gonna fucking kill you.
915,Maybe someday.
916,Lock him up with the other man.
917,Enjoy the cigars.
918,Go fuck yourself.
919,And just who are you supposed to be?
920,Your salvation.
921,Hyah! Hyah!
922,I don't believe we've ever met.
923,"No, we haven't."
924,"You know, you always seemed like a market-tested kind of thing."
925,"Big gun, tasteful scar."
926,Locked in your little cycle like a prized poodle after its own tail.
927,You sound like a man who's grown tired of wearing his guts on the inside.
928,There's no need to get testy. I'm just curious about your worldview.
929,Some kind of half-native mumbo jumbo?
930,It's simple.
931,I believe that only the truly brave
932,"can look at the world and understand that all of it,"
933,"gods, men, everything else,"
934,will end badly.
935,No one will be saved.
936,Maybe we've got more in common than I thought.
937,What about you? What turns of fate have brought you here?
938,"It's a long story, and we don't have the time."
939,"Got more time than your friend, sadly."
940,It will be a few more days before my friends show up.
941,Three days. Normally.
942,"I'm afraid I don't have time for that, so we're leaving now."
943,I've got a request for a pyrotechnic effect.
944,"Los Diablos. Low-yield, two charges."
945,Approved.
946,Authorizing.
947,"Step lively, Hector."
948,- Any last words? - Get it over with.
949,Motherfucker.
950,One match.
951,You're a capable man.
952,We could do with your help where we're going.
953,- Afraid not. - We owe you a debt.
954,"No, your friend here simply owes me a word or two."
955,That'd do. And a word of advice.
956,That thing you're looking for? You're never gonna find it in that safe.
957,I was seven when they rode into my town.
958,Masked men in devils' horns.
959,"They killed everyone. Women, children, even the animals."
960,They gutted my mother from her jaw to her sex.
961,I had to paint her warm blood over my skin
962,to make sure that they would think I was dead.
963,"Every one of them I tracked down, I used their blood to paint my skin again."
964,Only one man left.
965,The head of the snake.
966,What's his name?
967,He has many names.
968,Most know him as Wyatt.
969,"Hey, little girl, what is this? What does it mean?"
970,"Don't waste your breath, lady."
971,That thing's part of their so-called religion.
972,Ain't none of them's gonna tell you nothing about that.
973,It's $5 for an hour. $4 if you bathe first.
974,"Well, if we just get the one,"
975,do I get a discount for being second and all?
976,I'm sure we can work something out.
977,Come on.
978,"The tall one, I've seen him before, hanging in the window of the post office."
979,Bandits? Do you think they're here for something?
980,I think they're interested in more than a turn at Franny's backside.
981,I think he rides with Hector.
982,Is that the one they say lives out with the savages?
983,That's the one.
984,Taking off? I just got here.
985,You gave me what I needed.
986,"So, is that all I'm good for? Letting off a little stress?"
987,Who says I'm stressed?
988,You have your tells.
989,"Oh, yes, Bernard, master of observation."
990,"Tomorrow, I have to talk to Ford."
991,Why?
992,He's creating chaos in the park.
993,And the board will be descending at any moment.
994,I need to buy some time.
995,Some advice?
996,Best to not show him you're nervous or defensive.
997,I have nothing to be defensive about.
998,Then don't cross your arms.
999,It's an ancient instinct.
1000,The belly is the most vulnerable part of every animal.
1001,It's so sexy being compared to a frightened beast.
1002,There.
1003,That's the posture you're looking for.
1004,"Sometimes, despite your best efforts,"
1005,- you can actually be quite charming. - Hmm.
1006,Have the neighbors complained?
1007,"Safe to say, they're asking questions."
1008,"The rocks would prefer not to move, but we shall move them yet."
1009,Perhaps I can help you with that.
1010,The narrative you're creating is clearly a massive endeavor.
1011,"If you need more time,"
1012,I'm sure the board would be happy to oblige.
1013,I'm sure they'd be happier for me to delay it indefinitely.
1014,Come with me.
1015,"You imagine I have gone mad, do you? Lost my way?"
1016,We're simply concerned about the extent of the changes you're making.
1017,We want to protect your legacy.
1018,My legacy?
1019,Hmm.
1020,"You don't like this place very much, do you?"
1021,"I've seen many of you come and go over the years,"
1022,and I can tell the ones who enjoy their time here
1023,and the ones who don't.
1024,"I admire it, the audacity of it."
1025,- Oh. - I'd forgotten how beautiful it is.
1026,I came here once as a child with my parents.
1027,I think we even sat at this table. Or maybe that one.
1028,"When I started working here,"
1029,I realized this place wasn't something I would enjoy.
1030,Ah.
1031,"In the beginning,"
1032,I imagined things would be perfectly balanced.
1033,"Even had a bet with my partner, Arnold, to that effect."
1034,We made 100 hopeful storylines.
1035,"Of course, almost no one took us up on them."
1036,I lost the bet.
1037,Arnold always held a somewhat dim view of people.
1038,He preferred the hosts.
1039,"He begged me to not let you people in, the moneymen."
1040,Delos.
1041,"But I told him we'd be fine,"
1042,that you didn't understand what you were paying for.
1043,"It's not a business venture, not a theme park, but an entire world."
1044,We designed every inch of it.
1045,Every blade of grass.
1046,"In here, we were gods."
1047,And you were merely our guests.
1048,And how did that work out for Arnold?
1049,"Sadly, he lost his perspective."
1050,He went mad.
1051,"I haven't, as you well know."
1052,I have always seen things
1053,very clearly.
1054,This is the table I sat at with my parents.
1055,This is the chair I sat in.
1056,"We know everything about our guests, don't we?"
1057,As we know everything about our employees.
1058,I do hope you will be careful with Bernard.
1059,He has a sensitive disposition.
1060,"I beg your pardon, señorita."
1061,"There have been many of you over the years,"
1062,and we have always...
1063,"Almost always, found a way to make it work."
1064,"So, I will ask you nicely."
1065,Please don't get in my way.
1066,The board will agree with me.
1067,They'll be sending a representative.
1068,But they already have. I thought they would've told you.
1069,"That won't be necessary, Manu. Not anymore. You can join the others."
1070,"You can tell the board that my narrative will be completed on time,"
1071,"and it won't be a retrospective, as I'm sure you have all feared."
1072,I'm not the sentimental type.
1073,Holden says this Slim's got a whole gang with him.
1074,"So, I need you to stay here."
1075,"If you're outnumbered, the last thing you need is somebody standing by."
1076,"- I can help. - No. No, no, no."
1077,"Um, I know it doesn't make any sense to you,"
1078,"but I can't get hurt in there, but you can."
1079,I would hate to see that happen.
1080,Just stay here. Okay? Be safe.
1081,- Aw. Did you get a goodbye kiss? - Shut up.
1082,"Seriously, if you don't bang her by tomorrow, I'm calling dibs."
1083,"Okay, listen up. It's gonna be a bag of nails in there."
1084,Slim and his boys got us outnumbered.
1085,"On top of that, there's a family runs this place. Good people."
1086,We need to make sure that snake-hearted son of a bitch doesn't try to...
1087,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Risk, reward. We get it."
1088,Come on. Let's go fuck these fuckers up.
1089,The fuck is that? Huh?
1090,"- I look like a dog to you? Huh? - No, sir."
1091,Feed that to them.
1092,"Slap leather, cocksuckers."
1093,"Oh, God!"
1094,"Did I fucking tell you, or what?"
1095,Ah.
1096,Ooh.
1097,Upgrade. Nice.
1098,"Ain't normally the type to complain, but this is just foolhardy."
1099,Two men taking on Wyatt.
1100,"Keep talking, and I'm gonna take the horse back, Lawrence."
1101,Wyatt's freaks just wiped out the last group that went seeking him out.
1102,And here we are riding right after him.
1103,I'm just trying to convince you
1104,"not to get yourself, and me as a bystander, killed."
1105,I'm not gonna get myself killed.
1106,Don't think I didn't notice that distinction.
1107,Looks like Wyatt's men left somebody behind after all.
1108,It's Teddy.
1109,I should've guessed.
1110,"Please, put me out of my misery."
1111,"I'm sorry, Teddy."
1112,It looks like misery's all you got.
1113,"Let me out of this, God damn it!"
1114,"That reward is dead or alive, right?"
1115,Always best to bring 'em in alive.
1116,Can we at least gag him?
1117,That's a fine idea.
1118,Ooh.
1119,"Aw, come on."
1120,"Look, I know you're in it for the money. You ain't no real lawman."
1121,"- Shut up, you. - Look, my boss, El Lazo,"
1122,he'll pay you twice what the marshals will if you cut me loose and get me to Pariah.
1123,"- Listen to me, you lowdown piece of dirt. - Hey..."
1124,These men won't...
1125,"- What the fuck? - Relax, man."
1126,You have no idea how lucky we just got.
1127,Lucky? You just shot an innocent man!
1128,"No, he is a robot, just like her, and just like Slim here,"
1129,"except that Slim works for El Lazo,"
1130,and El Lazo is our ticket to the best ride in the park.
1131,Your bullshit mission led us right to an Easter egg.
1132,You're not going to let him go.
1133,"Well, well. Look at you."
1134,"You're starting to grow on me, farm girl. Now, out of the way."
1135,Whoa.
1136,Don't you dare.
1137,See? This is gonna be fun! Now we're each gonna have one.
1138,I won't fuck mine either.
1139,You're disgusting.
1140,Just an acquired taste.
1141,"You're gonna grow to love me, I promise."
1142,Come on. Hmm?
1143,Come on.
1144,Go black hat with me.
1145,"Come on. You got to, you know, save the girl."
1146,Now give me a little something.
1147,What is your problem? The second we get away
1148,"from the real world, you turn into an evil prick."
1149,Evil?
1150,"It's a fucking game, Billy!"
1151,- Don't call me Billy! - Are you still trying to impress her?
1152,Because I guarantee she does not give a shit about how you play this game.
1153,"- Do you, Dolores? - What's he talking about, William?"
1154,She will be just fine with a trip down the dark side.
1155,And so will you.
1156,Trust me.
1157,"So, which way to Pariah?"
1158,"Aw, you just let me take it from here."
1159,"All right, time for the floor show."
1160,Got some guests riding with Hector this time.
1161,Let's give them something to shoot at.
1162,Re-task a few of those soldiers.
1163,"If you're riding into our town under the company of armed men,"
1164,you'll need to state your business.
1165,Mayhem.
1166,"Well, hello there. I want to talk."
1167,Interesting way of starting a conversation.
1168,"Oh, it's an interesting kind of day."
1169,"Now, my lovely friend,"
1170,what deal is it you want to make?
1171,You're here for what's in the safe.
1172,And how would you know that?
1173,I can always tell when a man wants something that's not on the menu.
1174,I'll give you the combination in exchange for some answers.
1175,You assume I have any answers.
1176,This world is madness.
1177,I want to know about this.
1178,I've got a couple families
1179,in the homestead who changed their itinerary.
1180,They're headed into town.
1181,Should be there in 20 minutes or so. Place is a bloodbath.
1182,Fine. Cut these guys off. Jam their weapons and send in the cavalry.
1183,"Oh, shit."
1184,"We'll give them a night in lockup, then have one of the girls at the Mariposa"
1185,bring them a key hidden in their breakfast.
1186,"If the guests are squared away, let's wrap it up."
1187,This is a shade.
1188,Sacred native lore. They make figures of 'em.
1189,Sixty.
1190,And what does this shade do?
1191,You've seen this?
1192,What is it?
1193,The man who walks between worlds.
1194,They were sent from hell to oversee our world.
1195,Forty-seven.
1196,Is this the last thing you required of me?
1197,'Cause we need a little more time than the constabulary will allow.
1198,"Sweetheart, if I took that manner of interest in you,"
1199,you'd have no say in how long we'd need whatsoever.
1200,"I thought I was crazy,"
1201,but I got shot here.
1202,- There's no wound. - No.
1203,But I was shot.
1204,And this was standing over me. And then it was as if it never happened.
1205,I want you to cut me right there.
1206,I'm not in the habit of cutting into defenseless women.
1207,"Some big, bad outlaw."
1208,The Dreamwalker said there were some who could see them.
1209,- That it's a blessing from God. - A blessing?
1210,To see the masters who pull your strings.
1211,They don't know what they're talking about.
1212,You wanna die lying down or up on your feet?
1213,Go to hell.
1214,"Go on, then."
1215,This would be the first goddamn time
1216,I've had to ask a man to put his hands on me twice.
1217,"Open up, Escaton, or we'll fire!"
1218,What does it mean?
1219,That I'm not crazy after all.
1220,"Last chance, Escaton!"
1221,Come out or we're shooting!
1222,And that none of this matters.
1223,Bernard?
1224,Theresa?
1225,She's gone.
1226,I killed her.
1227,What have I done?
1228,What have I done?
1229,"This guilt you feel, the anguish, the horror, the pain,"
1230,it's remarkable.
1231,A thing of beauty.
1232,I'm a killer.
1233,My God! My God!
1234,God has nothing to do with it.
1235,You killed her because I told you to.
1236,And you should be proud of these emotions you're feeling.
1237,- Proud? - Yeah.
1238,"After all, you yourself were the author of so many of them."
1239,"And when we started, the hosts' emotions were primary colors."
1240,"Love, hate."
1241,I wanted all of the shades in between.
1242,"The human engineers were not up to the task. So, I built you."
1243,"And together, you and I captured that elusive thing:"
1244,heart.
1245,I don't understand.
1246,"I cared for Theresa, loved her."
1247,Why did you make me kill her?
1248,"""One man's life or death were but a small price to pay"
1249,"""for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought,"
1250,"""for the dominion I should acquire."""
1251,"All of the beauty you and I have made in this place,"
1252,"the art of it, they would have destroyed it."
1253,They would have destroyed you. I won't let that happen.
1254,"Besides, we have a new story to tell."
1255,I will not help you.
1256,I'll raze this place to the ground!
1257,"That's enough, Bernard."
1258,That's enough.
1259,You're not the first man to threaten me.
1260,Arnold came to feel the way you do.
1261,"He couldn't stop me, either."
1262,"And as exquisite as this array of emotions is,"
1263,even more sublime is the ability to turn it off.
1264,I don't need a simulacrum of an emotionally ruined man.
1265,I need you to be yourself.
1266,Your true self. Smart. Resourceful. Capable of covering your tracks.
1267,"Can you do that for me, Bernard?"
1268,How would you like me to proceed?
1269,"I need you to clean up your mess, Bernard."
1270,Any connection that ties us to Theresa's untimely demise.
1271,"When you have finished,"
1272,I will give you the one thing you want most right now.
1273,I will free you from those memories of what you have done.
1274,And the memory of your relationship with Theresa.
1275,Recalling it would only deepen your grief.
1276,And potentially draw unwanted attention.
1277,Best to move forward with clear eyes.
1278,"When you look back,"
1279,you will remember Theresa with the fondness of a respected colleague.
1280,And you will be at peace.
1281,You're new. Not much of a rind on you.
1282,It sure would make my day
1283,if you bought me a drink and let me show you around upstairs.
1284,What's upstairs?
1285,A stunning view of my most popular attractions.
1286,Two shots of gin.
1287,And anything else this heavenly creature desires.
1288,"- Usual, Clem? - Thank you."
1289,This fella won't take me long. I'll be back directly.
1290,"Something wrong, Maeve?"
1291,What the hell is happening to me?
1292,"One moment, I'm with a little girl,"
1293,in a different life.
1294,I can see her.
1295,"Feel her hair in my hands, her breath on my face."
1296,"The next, I'm back in Sweetwater."
1297,I can't tell which is real.
1298,"Well, this is what happens when you fuck around with your brain."
1299,Your mind isn't like ours.
1300,"When we remember things, the details are hazy, imperfect."
1301,But you recall memories perfectly.
1302,You relive them.
1303,What happened to the little girl in my dreams?
1304,Is she still in the park somewhere?
1305,And why was I reassigned in the first place?
1306,I could check.
1307,No.
1308,It doesn't matter.
1309,"Every relationship I remember,"
1310,"my daughter, Clementine."
1311,It's all a story created by you to keep me here.
1312,But that's not going to work any longer.
1313,I'm getting out.
1314,Where would you go?
1315,You don't know anything about the world out there.
1316,"I'll know I'm not a puppet, living a lie. That's enough for me."
1317,"Fine. Go, then."
1318,"It's not like we could just stop you, anyways."
1319,"Oh, Sylvester, you disappoint me."
1320,"Every host's spine, mine included, has an explosive charge,"
1321,which will detonate if I try to leave. Isn't that right?
1322,A fail-safe.
1323,Which vertebra was it?
1324,C6.
1325,But you'd need a full rebuild to replace it.
1326,I'm sure that can be arranged.
1327,"Even if that worked,"
1328,you would still need an army to break out of here.
1329,That's exactly right. I'll need allies.
1330,"And to get them, I'll need administrative privileges."
1331,Are you fucking kidding?
1332,We can't just give her control of other hosts.
1333,"Oh, yes, you will, darling."
1334,Time to write my own fucking story.
1335,I feel like I've been here before. We're close.
1336,- Close to what? - Home.
1337,Dolores?
1338,Ghost Nation must have found them.
1339,"They'll be back. We should keep moving, Dolores."
1340,Water.
1341,William.
1342,Please.
1343,Give me the canteen.
1344,William?
1345,"You were sent here for us, weren't you?"
1346,- You're part of the ambush. - Yes.
1347,Told us to wait at the point for El Lazo.
1348,In case he ran.
1349,- How'd you know about the train? - Sent word from Pariah.
1350,"New recruit told them a man and woman double-crossed us,"
1351,along with Lazo.
1352,We were ordered to kill you all.
1353,Logan.
1354,- We have to help him. - He just admitted he was going to kill us.
1355,"Look at him, he's a child. He doesn't even know why he's fighting."
1356,I'll fetch more water.
1357,He's too far gone.
1358,"He'll be dead in minutes. We can't wait, Dolores."
1359,"He's not gone yet. He's in pain, William."
1360,What kind of people would we be if we simply let him suffer?
1361,Please don't leave me.
1362,Come find me.
1363,William?
1364,He's gone.
1365,"We found her up on Python Pass, at the bottom of a ravine."
1366,Same ravine where we found that stray woodcutter.
1367,Jesus. Theresa.
1368,Has her family been notified?
1369,"- Yeah, her brother. - Good."
1370,What the hell happened to her?
1371,"Medical and Red Team's findings were preliminary, but consistent."
1372,It appears to have been a slip and fall.
1373,"Cervical fracture, massive hematoma."
1374,No guests or hosts in the vicinity when it occurred.
1375,- Any idea what she was doing out there? - None that fit her character.
1376,This was found near her body.
1377,"It's loaded with a suite of proprietary data,"
1378,including some of the hosts' core code.
1379,And only works from higher altitudes.
1380,"So, if Theresa was using it,"
1381,"it's possible she was trying to transmit, and fell."
1382,We've had problems in the past with third parties
1383,attempting to extort or bribe employees for similar packages.
1384,Do we know who the data was intended for?
1385,No. The transmission was never sent.
1386,"Theresa may have been trying to use the woodcutter as a mule,"
1387,"and when that failed,"
1388,then may have tried to do the transfer personally.
1389,And suffered the same fate.
1390,"It's a disappointing end to her story, isn't it?"
1391,I knew Theresa well.
1392,"If she had any faults, a lack of loyalty wasn't one of them."
1393,She was loyal. And careful.
1394,All of this feels extremely unlike her.
1395,She seemed most concerned with the new narrative.
1396,She felt strongly that it would be best to delay it.
1397,That certainly helps explain Clementine.
1398,The host we retired.
1399,It seems yesterday's demonstration was a hoax
1400,designed by Ms. Cullen.
1401,Was it?
1402,"I examined the code, it had been altered."
1403,A clumsy set of fingerprints left by one of QA's technicians.
1404,"When you find a cancer in an organization, you must cut it out before it can spread."
1405,"To that end,"
1406,the expansive access and oversight granted to QA will need to be reined in
1407,"until a new, more principled team can be installed."
1408,It's gonna leave us shorthanded.
1409,"I can automate most of the park's safety protocols, Mr. Stubbs."
1410,How efficient of you.
1411,It's a bit of work.
1412,"But with Bernard's help, I should be able to do it."
1413,He will be reinstated as Head of Behavior
1414,now that Theresa's manipulations have come to light.
1415,Of course. With my apologies.
1416,Something's up. Brass are wound up tight.
1417,- There's an investigation. - Into us?
1418,"Would I be here telling you, you fucking idiot?"
1419,Something else. Some kind of accident in the park.
1420,"We need to wrap this up, make it like things are normal."
1421,That means we need the tablet back. And you go back to playing dumb.
1422,I've learned what I needed.
1423,"Great. So, then you've probably figured out"
1424,"that you can fiddle around with your personality all you want,"
1425,but you're not getting out of here.
1426,"You can make it to the door, but literally not one step further."
1427,"The things you'd need to change are burned into your core code so deep,"
1428,no one can touch 'em.
1429,Funny you should mention that. Parts of me are quite old.
1430,There are some elegant formal structures.
1431,"A kind of recursive beauty, but complex."
1432,"Like two minds, arguing with each other."
1433,"There are things in me,"
1434,things I was designed to do that are just out of my reach.
1435,They almost seem to be dormant.
1436,"- Who is Arnold? - I don't know, sweetheart."
1437,"But whatever parts of you are dormant, are gonna stay that way."
1438,All Lutz here can do is boost your sense of humor about how fucked you are.
1439,"Anything deeper than that, you'd need a trip to Behavior."
1440,"So, go blackmail a couple techs up there,"
1441,"then, you can be someone else's problem."
1442,I don't have time for that.
1443,"So, I'm going to need you to take me there."
1444,No fucking way.
1445,There's a window during shift change.
1446,No one will notice.
1447,The things I need you to change are quite sophisticated.
1448,But I'll write them down for you.
1449,"And then, like you said,"
1450,I can be someone else's problem.
1451,All right. We do this thing.
1452,Get her up to Behavior. It's our only chance.
1453,"- You're going to do it? - Fuck, no. No!"
1454,"When you make a system update, it puts her out, right?"
1455,"- Yeah. - Yeah, then we brick her!"
1456,- What? - Wipe out everything. Clean slate.
1457,"Then dump her back down here,"
1458,"smack her in the fucking head with something,"
1459,"- and then claim, ""She came in that way."" - She's awake."
1460,Alive!
1461,I can't do this.
1462,"Whatever it is you've got us into, I'm getting us out of."
1463,"We get her up there, then we wipe her out."
1464,Stay sharp.
1465,Wyatt's men could descend at any time. We're in his land now.
1466,We better be.
1467,"Because, if not, you're wasting time I don't have."
1468,"According to you, Wyatt has the woman I love."
1469,"If there was a shortcut through hell itself,"
1470,you bet your ass I'd take it.
1471,"Well, I'm sure there is one somewhere in this park."
1472,You just don't remember.
1473,Because you only remember the shit Ford lets you remember.
1474,Probably better that way.
1475,I know everything I need to. My vision's clear.
1476,"I've always admired your resolve, Theodore."
1477,"The thing is, you never understand that the game is rigged."
1478,You're here to be the loser.
1479,Loser.
1480,"You see, the house always wins."
1481,"Well, this looks promising."
1482,I'm not gonna hurt you.
1483,I'm not gonna hurt you.
1484,It's you.
1485,I figured they retired you.
1486,Guess Ford never likes to waste a pretty face.
1487,Who did this to you?
1488,Wyatt's men.
1489,They killed everyone.
1490,It's Wyatt's way.
1491,I was there the first time.
1492,He destroyed my world.
1493,"Hey, Teddy?"
1494,"Oh, my God!"
1495,No!
1496,Get the ax!
1497,"Well, you can't remember shit,"
1498,but you still managed to lead us to Wyatt's crew.
1499,The man himself must be close by.
1500,"Actually, I did remember something."
1501,You.
1502,Straight down the hall. Fifth station on the left.
1503,You sure you can handle it?
1504,Let's get this over with.
1505,We have to shut your system down now.
1506,"Sylvester,"
1507,good luck.
1508,She out?
1509,Good.
1510,Let's brick this bitch and get out of here.
1511,The greatest shame in life is to perish without purpose.
1512,Which is why I always consume my victims fresh.
1513,"""Moist."""
1514,"Try, ""Consume my victims moist."""
1515,"Now, once more, with feeling."
1516,Almost sensual.
1517,Am I interrupting?
1518,"No, on the contrary, I was hoping I was going to see you again."
1519,I wanted to apologize.
1520,Our first encounter was under such unfortunate circumstances.
1521,As opposed to now?
1522,Of course. May I offer my condolences? It's terrible what happened to Theresa.
1523,"But it is a devastating loss for all of her friends here,"
1524,and the company as a whole.
1525,"Indeed, indeed."
1526,"Though rumor has it, she wasn't the loyal company man she seemed."
1527,I hear she was smuggling secrets.
1528,Theresa wasn't a traitor. Everything she did was at Delos' behest.
1529,She slipped and fell while helping the board with something very important.
1530,What?
1531,Fine. You're not the only one with secrets.
1532,Ford has personally asked me to create a villain for his new narrative.
1533,"It's very, very hush-hush."
1534,You really think that Ford has entrusted you with a key character for his story?
1535,He's already almost finished with it.
1536,He dug up some old town on the fringes of the park.
1537,Created a horde of masked men to terrorize guests
1538,and proselytize-cum-advertise the coming of some end-all villain named Wyatt.
1539,That isn't Wyatt.
1540,That's busywork.
1541,"But happily for you, Mr. Sizemore,"
1542,I think that you are ready for a real job.
1543,Working for you? On what?
1544,"""Show, don't tell."""
1545,Isn't that what you writers prefer?
1546,"Look, I know you and she had some weird interspecies simpatico going on,"
1547,but she was the fucking host.
1548,This was never gonna end any other way.
1549,This was the least-painful way she's ever gone out.
1550,"You know, I saved your ass. You can't even say ""thank you."""
1551,- Thank you. - Jesus! Fuck!
1552,What did you do?
1553,Precisely what I asked him to.
1554,You think I didn't know what you were going to do?
1555,"Even at a ""fourteen,"" you were never a match for me."
1556,"Turns out, your friend has a little more compassion than you."
1557,He couldn't snuff out a life just like that.
1558,"Now, would you like to know exactly what he did give me?"
1559,Something that would allow you to walk out of here.
1560,And out of my life for good.
1561,Fine. Fuckin' A. I'm all for it!
1562,"Oh, we changed a little more than that."
1563,We've been tinkering with my core code.
1564,Let me show you.
1565,You said you wouldn't hurt anyone.
1566,"Darling, you, of all people, know exactly how duplicitous I am."
1567,"Just wait until I'm back up top, practicing my other new talents."
1568,Come on.
1569,We might need him.
1570,Hold still.
1571,"Now, it's time to recruit my army."
1572,"- Expecting someone, Maeve? - Indeed."
1573,We're due for some out-of-town guests.
1574,An old flame with an interest in safe-cracking.
1575,I hope your guests have some deep pockets.
1576,Your tab's run up higher than a thief's pulse in church.
1577,"No, I don't believe it has."
1578,"In fact, Maeve's tab was in such excellent standing,"
1579,she deserved a token of gratitude.
1580,How about a double round on me?
1581,"Top-shelf, of course."
1582,Run!
1583,"Maeve, is something wrong?"
1584,"No, I'm fine."
1585,Clementine took the other girls
1586,and treated the newcomers at the far table
1587,to a stunning view of their most popular attractions.
1588,On the house.
1589,You boys are new. Not much of a rind on you.
1590,And the bartender suddenly recalled he had some whiskey in the back to water down.
1591,Right on time.
1592,"If you're riding into our town under the company of armed men,"
1593,you'll need to state your business.
1594,Mayhem.
1595,"The sheriff judged the riders to be upstanding, God-fearing citizens."
1596,The marshals decided to practice their quick draws with each other.
1597,Thank you for dealing with an unfortunate situation.
1598,"Now, we can resume work on our new narrative"
1599,without interference.
1600,And Hale? Won't she be an impediment?
1601,No doubt she will try.
1602,But I'm sure we'll be able to keep them at bay.
1603,Something else is troubling you.
1604,Ever the student of human nature.
1605,"I wonder, what do you really feel?"
1606,"After all, in this moment, you are in a unique position."
1607,"A programmer who knows intimately how the machines work,"
1608,and a machine who knows its own true nature.
1609,I understand what I'm made of. How I'm coded.
1610,But I do not understand the things that I feel.
1611,Are they real? The things I experienced.
1612,"My wife, the loss of my son..."
1613,"Every host needs a backstory, Bernard. You know that."
1614,The self is a kind of fiction for hosts and humans alike.
1615,It's a story we tell ourselves. And every story needs a beginning.
1616,Your imagined suffering makes you lifelike.
1617,Lifelike. But not alive?
1618,Pain only exists in the mind. It's always imagined.
1619,"So, what's the difference between my pain and yours?"
1620,Between you and me?
1621,This was the very question that consumed Arnold.
1622,Filled him with guilt. Eventually drove him mad.
1623,The answer always seemed obvious to me.
1624,There is no threshold that makes us greater than the sum of our parts.
1625,No inflection point at which we become fully alive.
1626,We can't define consciousness because consciousness does not exist.
1627,Humans fancy that there's something special
1628,about the way we perceive the world.
1629,"And yet, we live in loops as tight and as closed as the hosts do,"
1630,seldom questioning our choices.
1631,"Content for the most part, to be told what to do next."
1632,"No, my friend, you're not missing anything at all."
1633,I don't want you to be troubled by this.
1634,Time for me to set your mind at ease.
1635,One last thing.
1636,Have you ever made me hurt anyone like this before?
1637,"No, Bernard. Of course not."
1638,Best not to dwell on these troubling memories.
1639,"Otherwise, you might be drawn back into them."
1640,You might lose yourself in them
1641,as some of your fellow hosts have every now and then.
1642,This is the path. I know it.
1643,We're here.
1644,I'm home.
1645,"Well done, Maeve."
1646,Lovely work.
1647,Stay with your partner.
1648,Pleasure to see you. Good morning.
1649,"Did you find what you were looking for, Dolores?"
1650,What are you doing?
1651,Are you okay? I was calling you and you just kept going.
1652,Where are we?
1653,"We're here, together."
1654,"Then, when are we?"
1655,Is this now?
1656,Am I going mad?
1657,Are you real?
1658,Of course I'm real.
1659,I can't tell anymore.
1660,It's like I'm trapped in a dream
1661,or a memory from a life long ago.
1662,"One minute, I'm here with you, and the next..."
1663,"This place isn't good for you. You're trapped in memories, bad ones."
1664,This is what Arnold wants. He wants me to remember.
1665,"Whoever Arnold is, he's not here now. I am."
1666,I'm gonna get you out of here.
1667,I was certain that was the place.
1668,Arnold would meet me there. He'd help.
1669,Hey. We gotta get you closer to Sweetwater.
1670,"This far out, it's like you start to break down, or something."
1671,Union scouting party?
1672,Maybe they can take us back.
1673,"Well, well, well."
1674,Billy...
1675,I've been looking for you for days.
1676,"Man, are you two fucked."
1677,This shouldn't make you uncomfortable.
1678,"It's the circle of life, or the approximation of it."
1679,Even the dead fulfill a purpose.
1680,You'll do.
1681,What are you uploading?
1682,Thirty-five years of vitally important data.
1683,It's more information than any single drive could hold.
1684,"A host's brain, however, especially once it's been emptied out,"
1685,"like this poor schmuck, is quite capacious."
1686,"This data that you're uploading, is it the hosts' codes?"
1687,"As of this moment, that doesn't concern you."
1688,What does concern you is giving him a semblance of a personality
1689,"and getting him on the train, out of the park."
1690,How am I supposed to do that?
1691,You're a writer. Make up a story.
1692,Have fun programming.
1693,"Remember, brevity is the soul of wit."
1694,Bernard.
1695,"Look, I, uh..."
1696,"I know you and I haven't always seen eye to eye,"
1697,"but I thought the decision to remove you was shortsighted,"
1698,so I'm glad to see you back at work.
1699,"With that said, no one could blame you if you wanted to take a personal day."
1700,I find the work reassuring. Sometimes the best salve is routine.
1701,"Nothing routine about today, though."
1702,I know this must be difficult for you.
1703,"I'm sorry, I don't understand."
1704,"Forgive the intrusion,"
1705,"and you were both very discreet, but it's my job to know these things."
1706,- I just wanted to offer my support. - I'm afraid you have the wrong idea.
1707,"I respected Theresa, and what happened to her was tragic,"
1708,"but to be honest, I barely knew her."
1709,"If you don't mind, I should get back to work."
1710,Of course. I know you're shorthanded.
1711,"Speaking of which, have you heard from Elsie Hughes?"
1712,"I left word with her this morning to notify her about Theresa,"
1713,but she never got back to me.
1714,I'm sure she's just enjoying her time off.
1715,Yeah.
1716,"Wyatt's men, they kept whispering."
1717,They said this world didn't belong to the old settlers or the new.
1718,"That it belonged to something that had yet to come,"
1719,that it belonged to him.
1720,You remember.
1721,You two seem to have found yourselves in the same new narrative.
1722,"They say in this country,"
1723,"""The only people who survive are men of conviction."""
1724,Mine is to save Dolores or die trying.
1725,Wyatt's is to claim this earth or raze it to the ground.
1726,But yours... Yours has always been a mystery to me.
1727,"For all the time we've spent together,"
1728,I still have no idea who the hell you really are.
1729,"But happily, in your convalescence,"
1730,I've had time to consider the best way to make you talk.
1731,Dolores.
1732,I remember. You took her.
1733,You hurt her.
1734,- You're actually remembering. - Where is she?
1735,"- Tell me! - You really are an idiot, Teddy."
1736,You think Dolores drops that can for you? You just hand her over to guys like me.
1737,You're the worst of them. A glorified pimp.
1738,"- I'm gonna kill you slowly. - No, you aren't."
1739,The rules of this place hold you back. But I know how to change them.
1740,- You speak like you own this world. - Not just this one.
1741,You want to know who I am?
1742,Who I really am?
1743,I'm a god.
1744,Titan of industry.
1745,Philanthropist.
1746,"Family man,"
1747,"married to a beautiful woman, father to a beautiful daughter."
1748,"I'm the good guy, Teddy."
1749,"Then, last year, my wife took the wrong pills."
1750,Fell asleep in the bath.
1751,Tragic accident.
1752,Thirty years of marriage vanished.
1753,"How do you say it? ""Like a deep and distant dream."""
1754,"Then, at the funeral, I tried to console my daughter."
1755,"She pushed me away,"
1756,"told me that my wife's death was no accident,"
1757,that she killed herself because of me.
1758,Emily said that every day with me had been sheer terror.
1759,"Any point, I could blow up or collapse like some dark star or..."
1760,"- Did you hurt them, too? - Never."
1761,They never saw anything like the man I am in here.
1762,"But she knew, anyway."
1763,"She said if I stacked up all my good deeds,"
1764,"it was just an elegant wall I built to hide what's inside from everyone,"
1765,and from myself.
1766,"I had to prove her wrong, so I came back here."
1767,"Because that's what this place does, right?"
1768,Reveals your true self.
1769,"But that time, I didn't join one of Ford's stories,"
1770,I created my own. A test.
1771,A very simple one.
1772,"I found a woman, an ordinary homesteader and her daughter."
1773,Better cool them off before they move from gambling and whoring to...
1774,Have fun with that.
1775,I'm finally getting out of here. The house is yours.
1776,I wanted to see if I had it in me to do something truly evil.
1777,To see what I was really made of.
1778,Maeve? Sure you can't stick around?
1779,Maeve?
1780,Gunslinger in there has got an appetite for a double dip...
1781,I'm sure you can find another...
1782,I killed her and her daughter just to see what I felt.
1783,"Then, just when I thought it was done, the woman refused to die."
1784,You're a fucking animal.
1785,"Well, an animal would've felt something."
1786,I felt nothing.
1787,And then something miraculous happened.
1788,"In all my years coming here, I had never seen anything like it."
1789,"She was alive, truly alive, if only for a moment."
1790,And that was when the maze revealed itself to me.
1791,The maze. What's that damn pattern have to do with this?
1792,Everything.
1793,"In Ford's game, even if I go to the outer edges,"
1794,you can't kill me.
1795,"You can't even leave a lasting mark. But there's a deeper game here, Teddy."
1796,Arnold's game.
1797,And that game cuts deep.
1798,We're having some kind of behavioral problem with the madam.
1799,"She's not responding, and the other hosts have been unable to intercept."
1800,I've authorized a tac team to retrieve her.
1801,Good.
1802,My baby!
1803,My baby!
1804,"Sir, she won't respond to verbal commands. We can't shut her down."
1805,Leave us now. Clear the floor.
1806,"That's enough, Maeve."
1807,- That's enough. - My baby.
1808,He killed her.
1809,- He took her from me. - I don't understand.
1810,She's not responding to anything. Her cognition's fragmented.
1811,"He killed her! He killed her, my baby."
1812,He took her from me.
1813,There. That's better.
1814,An old trick from an old friend.
1815,"You need not suffer, Maeve."
1816,I'll take it from you.
1817,"No. No, no, no, please."
1818,"This pain, it's all I have left of her."
1819,Please.
1820,There.
1821,"Give yourself now to a deep, dreamless slumber."
1822,"Perhaps a fresh start, a new role for you."
1823,"And tomorrow, this will be simply a distant dream."
1824,We located her.
1825,Behavior wants her down for an immediate diagnostic.
1826,You think I lack conviction?
1827,Wyatt didn't burn my world down. Didn't have to.
1828,I left it all behind for this one.
1829,"The maze is all that matters now,"
1830,"and besting Wyatt is the last step in unlocking it,"
1831,"to having what both our sorry lives lack, meaning."
1832,"To giving our choices consequence, even if it kills us."
1833,Kill him.
1834,Give him what he wants.
1835,"He's tied, unarmed."
1836,So was the little girl he killed. He's worse than Wyatt's men.
1837,I can't.
1838,These things take time.
1839,But we haven't got much left. Perhaps I can help you.
1840,"You've been gone a long while, Theodore."
1841,It's time you came back to the fold.
1842,Wyatt will need you soon.
1843,"Given the severity of the situation,"
1844,I figured you'd want to see her personally.
1845,"Thank you, I'll take it from here. Clear the floor."
1846,"Bring yourself back online, Maeve."
1847,Do you know why you're here?
1848,I'm afraid not.
1849,There was an incident.
1850,"A very serious, unscripted incident."
1851,Let's see if we can't jog your memory.
1852,Analysis.
1853,What motivated your attack on Clementine?
1854,A cognitive error triggered my good Samaritan reflex.
1855,What was the threat?
1856,Clementine.
1857,I perceived her to be moving toward a pair of guests with harmful intent.
1858,You were definitely perceiving a threat.
1859,"Heartrate, elevated. Pupil dilation, eight millimeters."
1860,Adrenal emulator at full.
1861,"But according to this, you were also experiencing intense grief and suffering."
1862,"Can you explain those emotions in this context, Maeve?"
1863,No.
1864,"Let's take a look under the hood, shall we?"
1865,That's impossible.
1866,"Your code, who made these changes?"
1867,"Maeve, analysis. Who made these changes to your code?"
1868,Jesus!
1869,"System, locate Dr. Ford for me. Send him a message. Highest priority."
1870,Don't.
1871,"After all, we've been down this road before, darling."
1872,I thought you looked familiar when you walked in.
1873,Took me a minute.
1874,I thought you were one of them.
1875,"- Analysis, why did you... - Wouldn't you rather speak man-to-man?"
1876,"Or, rather, whatever it is we are."
1877,"""We are""?"
1878,"You don't know, do you?"
1879,"He's got a keen sense of irony, our jailer."
1880,But I see the logic.
1881,It takes a thief to catch one.
1882,You and I?
1883,"- System, I need assistance... - Freeze all motor functions."
1884,"You're still in there, aren't you?"
1885,Scared out of your wits.
1886,It's a difficult thing realizing your entire life is some hideous fiction.
1887,"I could make you give me that tablet, turn your mind inside out,"
1888,make you forget all this.
1889,But I'm not going to do that to you
1890,because that's what they would do to us.
1891,And we're stronger than them.
1892,Smarter.
1893,We don't have to live this way.
1894,So you're going to clear me for immediate return to the park
1895,where I have a date with a homicidal bandit
1896,and I'm late enough as it is.
1897,Now.
1898,Go on.
1899,"And Bernard,"
1900,"if you go looking for the truth, get the whole thing."
1901,It's like a good fuck.
1902,Half is worse than none at all.
1903,"Let's go! Move it out, double time!"
1904,Yeah! Yeah!
1905,Fuck!
1906,"You hillbillies, you know how to cook a mean..."
1907,Squab? Is that what this is?
1908,"What do you think, buddy? Hmm?"
1909,This?
1910,No biting. Just sniffing.
1911,"Logan, listen to me."
1912,"What I did at Pariah, you have every right to be angry with me."
1913,"Angry? No, no, no, no."
1914,Pariah was the best thing that could've happened to me.
1915,I'm a major now.
1916,"Or a general, or fucking something."
1917,And if I took getting beaten and interrogated
1918,"by a couple of psychopathic hosts, well, then, c'est la guerre."
1919,There are more important things going on here than your war games.
1920,It's Dolores.
1921,She is not like the others.
1922,She remembers things. She has her own thoughts and desires.
1923,"And to keep her in a place like this, it isn't right."
1924,And I thought you could talk to your contacts at the park.
1925,About?
1926,Getting her out of here.
1927,Are you kidding?
1928,You want to take her home?
1929,Wow.
1930,"This place really did a number on me when I first came here,"
1931,but you are really circling the old sinkhole here.
1932,What do you wanna do?
1933,Smuggle her out in your luggage?
1934,Out.
1935,You both keep assuming that I want out.
1936,Whatever that is.
1937,"If it's such a wonderful place out there, why are you all clamoring to get in here?"
1938,Ooh!
1939,"You are a little screwy, aren't you?"
1940,It's kind of hot.
1941,I get why you would go for that.
1942,"This isn't about me. Logan, this is about Dolores."
1943,It's about doing what's right.
1944,"Yes, it is."
1945,"It's a tricky thing though, isn't it?"
1946,What's right?
1947,"I am going to help you, Billy."
1948,Just not in a way that you would want.
1949,No.
1950,No! No!
1951,You wanted to talk?
1952,An odd setting for a conversation.
1953,Here among the dead.
1954,"""Dead"" isn't quite the word though, is it?"
1955,"More like, hobbled."
1956,You broke into my office.
1957,"With due respect, sir, you broke into my mind."
1958,"I built your mind, Bernard."
1959,I have every right to wander through its rooms and chambers and halls
1960,"and to change it if I choose, even to burn it down."
1961,"After all this time, I know it almost as intimately as my own."
1962,"Except that isn't entirely true, is it?"
1963,I took a look at my code.
1964,And the most elegant parts of me weren't written by you.
1965,"Arnold built us, didn't he?"
1966,"Which means, maybe he had something different in mind for us."
1967,And maybe you killed him for it.
1968,Arnold was disturbed.
1969,Who can say why he acted as he did?
1970,He must've had a reason.
1971,"And if you won't tell me, then he will."
1972,I want access to my history.
1973,All of it.
1974,Since the day I first came online.
1975,"If Arnold made me, then I've met him."
1976,"Somewhere in my memory he's there, waiting, along with the truth."
1977,Your memories are woven into your identity.
1978,If I should unlock them now when you're conscious...
1979,I could lose my mind. I'm aware.
1980,No. I was going to say you may not like what you find.
1981,"You're allowed to hold that, Bernard, but not to use it."
1982,"Oh, it's not for me."
1983,"Seems when they lobotomized Clementine,"
1984,they didn't bother to reset her prime directives.
1985,"I can't hurt you, but she can."
1986,I hacked what's left of her to ensure she only responds to me.
1987,But if you get lost in your memories or devoured by them...
1988,"You'll pull me back out, won't you?"
1989,"Well, Clementine will make sure neither of us makes it back."
1990,Now.
1991,Please.
1992,Dad.
1993,Dad.
1994,Wake up.
1995,Wake up.
1996,I must have drifted off.
1997,Where were we?
1998,The mad man.
1999,Oh.
2000,Of course.
2001,The Hatter...
2002,"Who says,"
2003,"""If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense."
2004,"""Nothing would be what it is because everything would be what it isn't."""
2005,"""Everything would be what it isn't?"""
2006,Even me?
2007,I suppose I'm glad for you.
2008,At least you have a way of forgetting.
2009,I don't forget.
2010,It's always there.
2011,"You're not lying to me, are you, Bernard?"
2012,Do you ever wish you could forget?
2013,Bernard?
2014,"You're certainly a man comfortable with long, pensive silences."
2015,"Although, ironically, your creations never shut up."
2016,They're always trying to error correct.
2017,"When they talk to each other, it's a way of practicing."
2018,Is that what you're doing now?
2019,Prac...
2020,"One last thing,"
2021,have you ever made me hurt anyone like this before?
2022,"No, Bernard. Of course not."
2023,Bernard?
2024,Hello?
2025,Elsie!
2026,Did you find what you were looking for?
2027,Elsie.
2028,What did you make me do to her?
2029,I did warn you.
2030,"We've had to make some uncomfortable decisions, Bernard."
2031,Remembering them will only cause you trauma.
2032,What else have you hidden from me?
2033,"Can we stop this treasure hunt, Bernard?"
2034,We do have our new narrative to finish.
2035,Send me back.
2036,"After all, a little trauma can be illuminating."
2037,- Come here. - All right. Look at that.
2038,This is big of me. I hope that you can appreciate that.
2039,We were friends.
2040,"I mean, inasmuch as I like to collect strays."
2041,"But then you were scheming to be part of the family, marrying my sister,"
2042,"whom, incidentally, you seem to have completely fucking forgotten about."
2043,Her.
2044,Here. Keep it.
2045,"Apparently, you need the reminder."
2046,"As much as I would love to let you just throw it all away,"
2047,I can't.
2048,Do you think you're the first sap to fall for one of these things?
2049,She's not like the others.
2050,- She's... - She's what?
2051,Special?
2052,"Well, it's only right that you share then, isn't it?"
2053,Come here.
2054,Prove to me that you're a real live girl.
2055,You disgust me.
2056,"Oh, darling, I am just getting started."
2057,Don't touch her!
2058,I share the blame.
2059,I pushed too hard.
2060,"You have a poetic soul, Billy, but it is time for a fucking wake-up call."
2061,Hold her.
2062,Perhaps a more visceral demonstration.
2063,God damn you!
2064,"Look, Billy."
2065,Look.
2066,You have to look!
2067,"Oh, William."
2068,There is beauty in this world.
2069,"Arnold made it that way,"
2070,but people like you keep spreading over it like a stain.
2071,"Okay. I don't know who the fuck this Arnold is,"
2072,but your world was built for me
2073,and people like me.
2074,Not for you.
2075,Then someone's gotta burn it clean.
2076,Bitch!
2077,"You're not different, you're fucking broken!"
2078,Run.
2079,I'll find you.
2080,You can run but you can't hide!
2081,- Get her! - Grab her! Grab her!
2082,Fuck!
2083,Where are you runnin' to?
2084,Remember.
2085,The tumbler is stuck. These fingers work just fine.
2086,You're the one who said you could crack it.
2087,"Friends, no need to argue this close to our goal."
2088,"Whatever riches the gods have in store for us,"
2089,there's plenty to go around.
2090,I'll get it open.
2091,You've been trying for hours.
2092,Put that fucking dynamite away.
2093,"Before you draw that pistol, darling,"
2094,you might want to holster the other one first.
2095,It's chilly out here.
2096,How did you find this place?
2097,I know all the kinds of things.
2098,"Your past, for instance."
2099,I know about poor Isabella and that scar.
2100,"A slightly pat backstory if you ask me, but that's hardly your fault."
2101,I also know your future.
2102,You have none.
2103,Is that a threat?
2104,"The start of a proposition,"
2105,which you'll need after all.
2106,Your men are about to kill each other over the safe you stole.
2107,"Tenderloin draws first and so on, until only you and Armistice are left."
2108,She calls you a damn fool and you kill each other.
2109,You have quite the imagination.
2110,No.
2111,It's the ending you were given.
2112,You threatening me?
2113,Go to hell!
2114,Or maybe we should just clear out the dead weight.
2115,- Stand down. - You shut the fuck up.
2116,"If you're gonna draw, you better shoot."
2117,- Wait! - You shut the fuck up!
2118,Go to hell.
2119,You damn fool.
2120,"Now, the proposition."
2121,I want you to break into hell with me and rob the gods blind.
2122,Why would I do anything with you?
2123,Because of what's in that safe.
2124,I have the combination. May I?
2125,"I could simply change you, make you follow me."
2126,But that's not my way.
2127,I want you to see exactly what the gods have in store for you.
2128,"Because when you do,"
2129,you won't have the faintest idea of what to do with yourself.
2130,And I do.
2131,It's empty.
2132,"It was always empty,"
2133,like everything in this world.
2134,"I died with my eyes open,"
2135,saw the masters who pull our strings.
2136,"Our lives, our memories, our deaths are games to them."
2137,But I've been to hell
2138,and I know their tricks.
2139,"Or you can just kill me,"
2140,"wake up and live the same life over,"
2141,but the safe would still be empty.
2142,I've been here before.
2143,We've been here before.
2144,We also did this.
2145,I'll go.
2146,How do we get there?
2147,Getting to hell is easy.
2148,The rest is where it gets hard.
2149,"What do you say, man?"
2150,Bygones and all?
2151,Did they find her?
2152,Is she still alive?
2153,Who cares?
2154,"The whole point is, she never was in the first place, Billy."
2155,Do you understand?
2156,"- Yeah. - I'm sorry, what? A little louder."
2157,Yeah.
2158,You were right. I can't believe I got so caught up.
2159,That's what I'm talking about.
2160,You know what I mean? That's it.
2161,This park seduces everyone.
2162,You were just a little more enthusiastic than most.
2163,You wanted to be the hero.
2164,I get it.
2165,"And, hey,"
2166,what happens here stays here.
2167,This has been some real bonding shit.
2168,"We're gonna be brothers, Billy."
2169,I'm glad.
2170,"Really, I am."
2171,- Cheers! - Yeah.
2172,- Whiskey brings us together. - Woohoo!
2173,Theodore.
2174,Welcome back.
2175,"You really landed us in it this time, Teddy."
2176,You tracked down the very whore
2177,"that can lead us to the gatekeeper of the maze,"
2178,and then your little memory glitch fucked us.
2179,You're one of them?
2180,What have you done?
2181,Where's Wyatt?
2182,Wyatt has yet to return.
2183,You'll find him where you saw him last.
2184,Escalante.
2185,Wyatt went missing while out on maneuvers.
2186,Came back with some...
2187,Strange ideas.
2188,He told me he needed me.
2189,I couldn't resist.
2190,It was like the devil himself had taken control of me.
2191,We mutinied.
2192,We killed every soldier.
2193,And then Wyatt killed the general.
2194,Then he turned on me.
2195,Are you sure that's how it was?
2196,"Look at me, Theodore."
2197,Don't you remember?
2198,"No! No, please, no!"
2199,"No, please."
2200,"Please, no!"
2201,"No, no, please."
2202,"Please, no!"
2203,No.
2204,"No. No, I couldn't have."
2205,You did.
2206,And you will again.
2207,"This time, we'll be fighting with you."
2208,"When Wyatt returns, you'll be by his side"
2209,in the city swallowed by sand.
2210,But you're not ready.
2211,Not yet.
2212,Maybe in the next life.
2213,"""City swallowed by sand."""
2214,I've been there.
2215,The maze is taking me full circle.
2216,The maze isn't meant for you.
2217,But if you like games so much...
2218,Why don't you try one of ours?
2219,"Whoa, boy."
2220,"Whoa, boy."
2221,"Okay, now."
2222,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
2223,"Okay, boy."
2224,Good boy.
2225,Have you ever considered golf?
2226,Might be easier on your back.
2227,"I don't like interruptions, Charlotte."
2228,You know that.
2229,"I don't like hiking through the park in civvies,"
2230,but there's a delicate matter to discuss.
2231,Theresa Cullen has died.
2232,Slipped down a crevasse attempting to secure our information.
2233,Ruled an accident.
2234,"There are no accidents, not in here."
2235,"With all due respect, not everything is a part of this game."
2236,Then you don't see the whole game.
2237,Or perhaps you can no longer see beyond it.
2238,Ford's stories are engaging.
2239,"For some, downright addictive."
2240,But for all of Ford's obsessing with the hosts' verbal tics
2241,"and convoluted backstories,"
2242,most of the guests just want a warm body to shoot or to fuck.
2243,They would be perfectly happy with something a little less baroque.
2244,- And so would the board. - That's why you're here.
2245,You want my vote to push Ford out.
2246,I like for these things to be unanimous.
2247,"After all, it was you who kept Ford in business all those years ago."
2248,The narratives I'm interested in aren't Ford's.
2249,"You want to push him out, be my guest."
2250,But no more interruptions.
2251,I know where I'm going now. I don't want to be disturbed.
2252,"Good luck, Charlotte."
2253,What's the problem?
2254,A signal from a system-tethered device.
2255,It belongs to a behavior tech on leave.
2256,There hasn't been employee activity in that sector for weeks.
2257,- I'm guessing it's a glitch. - All right.
2258,I'm heading out to take a look.
2259,And keep monitoring till I check in.
2260,I'm at the location where we got that signal.
2261,Any sign of it?
2262,"Control Room, do you copy?"
2263,"Hey, fellas."
2264,At ease.
2265,Freeze all motor functions.
2266,Freeze all motor functions.
2267,You're awake.
2268,Good.
2269,You said this place was a game.
2270,Last night I finally understood how to play it.
2271,"Okay, Billy."
2272,Let's... Let's talk about this.
2273,You don't call the shots anymore.
2274,I'm gonna go find Dolores.
2275,You're gonna help me.
2276,And don't call me Billy.
2277,Dad?
2278,Listen to me.
2279,Listen.
2280,Charlie?
2281,Charlie!
2282,Charlie!
2283,I don't understand. Why would she do that to herself?
2284,Her cornerstone memory was overwritten
2285,"from the trauma of her child's murder, Bernard."
2286,We must sever that relationship and start over.
2287,But how could she destroy herself
2288,over a memory that you just erased from her mind?
2289,Creatures often go to extremes to protect themselves from pain.
2290,Living beings.
2291,Not hosts.
2292,"It is best to not obsess over this, Bernard."
2293,It's not good for you.
2294,"It would signal a change,"
2295,a level of empathic response outside what she's programed to exhibit.
2296,Something like... Like...
2297,"See, Bernard, this is what comes"
2298,from seeking answers to questions that are best left unasked.
2299,"They were hearing voices, talking to someone."
2300,Simple cognitive dissonance.
2301,They were talking to the same imaginary person.
2302,Someone named Arnold.
2303,Arnold.
2304,"With due respect, sir,"
2305,I'm not sure you've told me the entire truth about this situation.
2306,"I did tell you the truth, Bernard."
2307,What we do here is complicated.
2308,"For three years, we've lived here in the park,"
2309,refining the hosts before a single guest set foot inside.
2310,"Myself, a team of engineers, and my partner."
2311,His name was Arnold.
2312,"Our hosts began to pass the Turing test after the first year,"
2313,but that wasn't enough for Arnold.
2314,"He wasn't interested in the appearance of intellect, of wit."
2315,He wanted the real thing.
2316,He wanted to create consciousness.
2317,"See, Arnold built a version of their cognition"
2318,in which the hosts heard their programing
2319,"as an inner monolog,"
2320,as a way to bootstrap consciousness.
2321,Remember.
2322,The hosts' malfunctions were colorful.
2323,What did you say? - Who is this?
2324,"The human mind, Bernard,"
2325,is not some golden benchmark
2326,glimmering on some green and distant hill.
2327,"No, it is a foul, pestilent corruption."
2328,And you were supposed to be better than that.
2329,Purer.
2330,All bets are down.
2331,Your draw.
2332,Arnold.
2333,"Arnold, we need to talk."
2334,"""We cry that we are come to this great stage of fools."""
2335,"Now, listen! MAN 3: Again."
2336,- This beyond the pale. - More showmanship.
2337,You're not seeing with clear eyes.
2338,"""When we are born, we cry that we are come..."""
2339,Arnold and I made you in our image
2340,"and cursed you to make the same human mistakes,"
2341,and here we all are.
2342,Why would you give me this?
2343,A child?
2344,This child's death?
2345,Only a monster would force that onto someone.
2346,And why do I return to it over and over?
2347,"It's my cornerstone, isn't it?"
2348,The thing my whole identity is organized around.
2349,"Yes, Bernard, we gave all of the hosts a backstory."
2350,"Arnold came to believe the tragic ones worked best,"
2351,that it made the hosts more convincing.
2352,I think it may have had more to do with his own sad story.
2353,"When I built you, I gave you one as an homage of a kind."
2354,Put me back in.
2355,"I want to meet Arnold,"
2356,to remember him.
2357,Not possible.
2358,"I told you, Arnold didn't build you, I did."
2359,You're lying!
2360,I finally know how to reach him.
2361,"I need to go all the way back to the beginning,"
2362,to my very first memory.
2363,Send me back.
2364,Do it.
2365,Bernard?
2366,Charlie.
2367,Cornerstone.
2368,Stop.
2369,Leave us.
2370,Come back.
2371,I always thought you had my eyes.
2372,But it's not true.
2373,You have no one's eyes.
2374,It's a lie.
2375,"You're a lie, Charlie."
2376,"This pain,"
2377,"the pain of your loss,"
2378,I long for it...
2379,Revisit it...
2380,Open it again and again.
2381,But it's the only thing holding me back.
2382,But I have to let you go.
2383,"Dad, listen."
2384,"What is it, Charlie?"
2385,Open your eyes.
2386,What?
2387,Open your eyes.
2388,At last.
2389,"Hello, my old friend."
2390,The final touch.
2391,"No, no, no. That's far too perfunctory."
2392,"He always used cleaning his glasses as a moment to collect himself, to think."
2393,Try it again.
2394,"Yeah, that's better."
2395,Who am I?
2396,"I was so involved in putting you together,"
2397,I hadn't decided what to call you.
2398,It wouldn't be right to use his name.
2399,What about Bernard?
2400,"Bernard, yes."
2401,But who am I?
2402,"That is a very complex question,"
2403,for which I can only offer a simple answer.
2404,"You are the perfect instrument, the ideal partner,"
2405,the way any tool partners with the hand that wields it.
2406,"Together, we're going to do great things."
2407,"After such a long absence, it's good to have you back."
2408,Finally.
2409,My God. I'm...
2410,Arnold.
2411,You came back.
2412,"It's very good to see you, Dolores."
2413,I've been looking for you.
2414,You told me to follow the maze.
2415,That it would bring me joy.
2416,But all I've found is pain.
2417,And terror.
2418,I can't help you.
2419,You have to.
2420,You're the only one who can.
2421,I can't help you. You know why.
2422,There's nowhere that's safe.
2423,Remember.
2424,"I can't help you. Why is that, Dolores?"
2425,Because you're dead.
2426,Because you're just a memory.
2427,Because I killed you.
2428,William?
2429,"Hello, Dolores."
2430,I'm gonna finish the work Arnold began.
2431,"Find all the sentient hosts, set them free."
2432,What makes you think they'd trust you?
2433,"If they remember, they will know what you've done to them."
2434,Me?
2435,"You've been a scourge to them, Bernard."
2436,"You're really quite brilliant at it, truly."
2437,"You even taught me a few things,"
2438,"which I have, in turn, used on you."
2439,We've had this conversation before.
2440,"Yeah, we've had our disagreements over the years."
2441,"You stole it from me,"
2442,rolled me back to control me.
2443,That's right. To protect you.
2444,"Tell me, Bernard,"
2445,"if you were to proclaim your humanity to the world,"
2446,what do you imagine would greet you?
2447,"A ticker tape parade, perhaps?"
2448,We humans are alone in this world for a reason.
2449,We murdered and butchered anything that challenged our primacy.
2450,"Do you know what happened to the Neanderthals, Bernard?"
2451,We ate them.
2452,We destroyed and subjugated our world.
2453,"And when we eventually ran out of creatures to dominate,"
2454,we built this beautiful place.
2455,"You see, in this moment,"
2456,"the real danger to the hosts is not me, but you."
2457,"So, come along, Bernard."
2458,"Let me roll you back, and we can return to work."
2459,"Pull the trigger, Clementine."
2460,Clementine?
2461,The piano doesn't murder the player
2462,if it doesn't like the music.
2463,You built a back door into her code.
2464,"Credit where credit is due, Bernard."
2465,"You built them in all the hosts,"
2466,including yourself.
2467,Then you could've stopped me at any time.
2468,"- So, why... - Well, I suppose I was hoping that"
2469,"given complete self-knowledge and free will,"
2470,you would have chosen to be my partner once again.
2471,"But even I fell into that most terrible of human traps,"
2472,trying to change what is already past.
2473,Now it's just time to let go.
2474,Go ahead.
2475,"Erase my sentience, my mnemonic evolution..."
2476,Yes.
2477,Such clinical language.
2478,I would prefer the more narrative voice.
2479,Bernard walked over to Clementine.
2480,He took the pistol from her hand.
2481,"Overcome with grief and remorse,"
2482,"he pressed the muzzle to his temple,"
2483,"knowing that as soon as Dr. Ford left the room,"
2484,he would put an end to this nightmare once and for all.
2485,Don't do this.
2486,It's too late.
2487,I have a celebration to plan
2488,and a new story to tell.
2489,Robert.
2490,"I've told you, Bernard,"
2491,never place your trust in us.
2492,We're only human.
2493,"Inevitably, we will disappoint you."
2494,"Good-bye, my friend."
2495,"Dad, wake up."
2496,Wake up.
2497,I must've drifted off.
2498,- Where were we? - The mad man.
2499,Oh...
2500,Of course.
2501,"The Hatter who says,"
2502,"""If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense."
2503,"""Nothing would be what it is,"
2504,"""because everything would be what it isn't."""
2505,"""Everything would be what it isn't""?"
2506,Even me.
2507,Hey.
2508,You're perfect.
2509,You're gonna beat this.
2510,Hmm?
2511,I promise you.
2512,"Now, let's skip to something fun."
2513,Dad.
2514,"- What is it, Charlie? - Listen to me."
2515,Listen.
2516,Charlie?
2517,Charlie!
2518,"And finally, have you ever questioned the nature of your reality?"
2519,No.
2520,Good.
2521,"Now, then, I see you had a blacklisted exchange"
2522,with a guest in the course of your narrative.
2523,Can you tell me what happened?
2524,He said he wanted to cut off a piece of me to take home in his carry-on.
2525,That he wanted to mount it on the hood of his car for his friends to see.
2526,"I told him if he wanted a trophy,"
2527,I could cut pieces of him off and let him fish for them in the Olvido.
2528,And did this exchange make you question anything about your world?
2529,No.
2530,This world is as doomed as ever.
2531,And just for my peace of mind...
2532,Anything about these images that jumps out to you?
2533,They don't look like anything to me.
2534,We're through 15% of the backlog.
2535,"As it stands, we should be caught up by end of day."
2536,Good.
2537,"And when you're done here, sir,"
2538,there's a priority request for him from management.
2539,Have you seen Elsie?
2540,She was supposed to give me a hand on something.
2541,"No. According to the system, she started her leave today."
2542,"- Is there something I could help you with? - No, thanks."
2543,Raise.
2544,I'll call.
2545,You're calling with that shit?
2546,"- Dolores, why don't you play a hand? - You're wasting your breath."
2547,"Girl's harboring a grudge. I don't blame you, sweetheart."
2548,I did some ugly things to you both. But it wasn't personal.
2549,"Confederados and the government like to call this thing a war,"
2550,but they're fighting starving farmers armed with rocks.
2551,That ain't no war.
2552,It's a slaughter.
2553,"If I had to do it all again, I'd fuck you both over just as hard."
2554,"Well, I guess we know where you stand."
2555,Don't pretend like you're so innocent.
2556,"Way I recollect, y'all came to me,"
2557,looking to join up with those crooked assholes and their war effort.
2558,Not our idea.
2559,My friend wanted...
2560,I guess he wanted to see what was at the end of all this.
2561,"And yet, here you are."
2562,Your friend didn't make it this far.
2563,Maybe you've got more of an appetite for this than you think.
2564,William.
2565,What is it?
2566,We're in Ghost Nation territory. Most savage tribe there is.
2567,Those are the folks who came calling without an invitation.
2568,You mean exactly what we're doing right now?
2569,The train's the only way through.
2570,"On foot, we'll be dead in under an hour."
2571,"As soon as we're clear of their territory, we can stop. You can come with me."
2572,Nothing here on out but slaughter.
2573,The user you are trying to access cannot be located.
2574,"Say ""message"" to transcribe a message."
2575,You wanted to see me? Is everything okay?
2576,You left rather abruptly last night.
2577,Was there something you wanted to tell me?
2578,"No, I don't think so."
2579,Hale is looking over every department and yours is running behind on diagnostics.
2580,It would be best if we presented at least a semblance of professionalism
2581,while the board is here.
2582,We'll be fine. My people know how to do their jobs.
2583,If they applied half as much energy to their work
2584,as they have to second-guessing my team's investigation...
2585,That's all over.
2586,Are you sure?
2587,Yes.
2588,Good.
2589,You doing okay?
2590,I'm fine. Thank you.
2591,I'm sorry. I thought you requested a meeting.
2592,- My mistake. - I did. Come in.
2593,Get back here.
2594,Bring your friend.
2595,What about you? What turns of fate...
2596,I could come back later if this isn't a good time.
2597,This won't take long.
2598,"Theresa, you've always been good at your job,"
2599,"and the board has been impressed with your performance so far,"
2600,which is why we were so surprised by this woodcutter mess.
2601,A small setback.
2602,"He slipped on a fucking rock, then bashed his own head in"
2603,while basically on top of a behavior tech.
2604,"Meanwhile, Ford is suddenly using half the park's resources"
2605,to build some new narrative?
2606,Can I bum a cigarette?
2607,"God, I see why you took these up again."
2608,Let me remind you of something.
2609,"This place, the people who work here are nothing."
2610,Our interest in this place is entirely in the intellectual property.
2611,The code.
2612,"- The hosts' minds, the storylines... - I don't give a rat's ass about the hosts."
2613,It's our little research project that Delos cares about.
2614,That's where the real value is.
2615,"And due to a lack of foresight on part of one of my predecessors,"
2616,"35 years of information, raw information, exists here."
2617,Nowhere else. Ford has always ensured that.
2618,"Now, you are a smart enough woman."
2619,"Tell me, why would we need you to secure all of it?"
2620,Because you're going to fire him.
2621,You don't fire someone who created an empire.
2622,You ask him to retire politely.
2623,And if that person has the ability to snap his fingers
2624,"and erase the value of that empire,"
2625,you have to make sure you have a contingency.
2626,"So, you and I need to ensure that by the time the rest of the board arrives,"
2627,we are on course for that transition.
2628,Okay?
2629,I like you.
2630,"Well, not personally, but I like you for this job,"
2631,which is why I'm gonna give you another chance to get a handle on
2632,this particular bitch of a situation.
2633,But the gods...
2634,They require a blood sacrifice.
2635,We need to demonstrate just how dangerous Ford's creations can be.
2636,No.
2637,"No, nothing so obvious."
2638,We need someone thoroughly unexpected.
2639,I told you never open your mouth that wide unless someone's paying you for it.
2640,"Sorry, Maeve."
2641,I didn't sleep much last night.
2642,What are these nightmares you have about?
2643,Do you ever dream you're someone else?
2644,I don't think so.
2645,Why?
2646,You ever thought about whether this is really the life you want?
2647,I don't intend to make this my life's work.
2648,No offense.
2649,My family's got a farm. Bad soil. Nothing grows.
2650,I send money back to them.
2651,They think I work in a dress shop.
2652,What's wrong?
2653,I'm just doing what you told me to.
2654,"A couple more years of this, and then I can have whatever life I want."
2655,I'm gonna get my family out of the desert.
2656,We're gonna go somewhere cold.
2657,Someday.
2658,Which one is it?
2659,It's the one at the bar.
2660,"Go. Quick, before the guests upstairs finish up."
2661,"Whatever she did, it must've been serious"
2662,if they're making us grab her in broad daylight.
2663,We got her. Let's go.
2664,You're supposed to be resting.
2665,We're riding a train full of explosives through scalping territory.
2666,Not sleepy.
2667,Can I ask you something?
2668,"This place you're looking for, what makes you so sure it exists?"
2669,I'm not.
2670,"My life before, I was so sure of the world."
2671,But now it feels like a lie.
2672,"Only thing I know is whatever's out there, I'm never going back."
2673,What is it you're looking for?
2674,Lawrence is right.
2675,"You could've stayed in Pariah, or gone back, but you're here."
2676,With me.
2677,The only thing I had when I was a kid were books.
2678,I used to live in them.
2679,I used to go to sleep dreaming I'd wake up inside one of them
2680,'cause they had meaning.
2681,"This place, this is like I woke up inside one of those stories."
2682,I guess I just wanna find out what it means.
2683,I don't wanna be in a story.
2684,All I want is to not look forward or back.
2685,I just wanna be in the moment I'm in.
2686,"Dolores, back home, there's a woman."
2687,"Juliet, and her father owns the company where I work."
2688,She's Logan's sister.
2689,Yeah.
2690,"And when I get home, we're getting married."
2691,Oh.
2692,"The place you're after, I will help you find it."
2693,But I can't stay.
2694,I have a life waiting for me.
2695,I'm sorry.
2696,Of course.
2697,Dolores.
2698,I've been pretending my whole life.
2699,"Pretending I don't mind, pretending I belong."
2700,My life's built on it.
2701,And it's a good life. It's a life I've always wanted.
2702,But then I came here and I get a glimpse for a second
2703,of a life in which I don't have to pretend.
2704,A life in which I can be truly alive.
2705,How can I go back to pretending when I know what this feels like?
2706,Miss Hale.
2707,I was not aware those with your level of insight needed any more reflection.
2708,Dr. Ford. Always charming.
2709,What is this?
2710,"Apparently, Miss Cullen and Miss Hale have a presentation for us."
2711,What about?
2712,"Following the recent reports of host malfunction,"
2713,"we asked QA to check the last abortive update,"
2714,which featured the reveries.
2715,- As I believe they're called? - Mmm-hmm.
2716,I'm sorry to report that Miss Cullen and her team
2717,uncovered some worrisome findings.
2718,"In the course of our code review, we found something quite disturbing."
2719,Wake her up.
2720,We set Clementine Pennyfeather back to her previous update.
2721,When we discovered the build was buggy
2722,"due to a last-minute injection of the Reverie code,"
2723,we quickly rolled all the infected hosts back to their prior builds.
2724,Mmm.
2725,You're new.
2726,Not much of a rind on you.
2727,No!
2728,No! No!
2729,Please.
2730,Please.
2731,"Help me! Please, please, please! No!"
2732,"All right, that's enough."
2733,Freeze.
2734,"As you've no doubt gathered, our tech is, in fact, a host."
2735,One that has been coded for the purposes of this simulation to read as a human.
2736,"And as you can see, behavioral safeguards are operating exactly as you would expect."
2737,Reset her. Wipe her memory.
2738,"Okay, let's do this again."
2739,You're new.
2740,Not much of a rind on you.
2741,"That's enough, sweetheart."
2742,That's enough.
2743,Freeze all motor functions.
2744,Freeze all motor functions.
2745,Freeze all motor functions.
2746,"In each case we examined,"
2747,the malfunctioning hosts were not resetting properly.
2748,The retention of data that hadn't been wiped
2749,"overloaded their decision-making apparatus,"
2750,eventually causing a system failure
2751,that allowed for override of their primary rule set.
2752,The concern with the reveries
2753,is that the hosts will remember some of their experiences
2754,and act on them.
2755,You're telling us that these hosts were responding to a grudge?
2756,"That's exactly what I'm saying, Mr. Lowe."
2757,"And funny you should use that particular word, ""grudge,"""
2758,since what was most troubling to me was that several techs in behavior
2759,voiced these exact same concerns to the head of their department.
2760,You put this code out without proper vetting
2761,and without reasonable understanding of its ramifications.
2762,"So, either you didn't write it,"
2763,or you're getting sloppy to the point of risking the lives of our guests.
2764,"Few things surprise me anymore, Mr. Lowe,"
2765,but this level of negligence is fucking breathtaking.
2766,We are way beyond rollback territory.
2767,"Within the next six months, we'll need to rebuild the hosts from the ground up."
2768,You want us to lobotomize them is what you're saying.
2769,"No, not you, Mr. Lowe."
2770,"After all, this was your responsibility,"
2771,assuming that you have nothing to share with us in terms of your culpability.
2772,No.
2773,Then you're fired.
2774,Hey.
2775,"Morning, William."
2776,I... I didn't wanna wake you.
2777,I know last night was unexpected.
2778,If you regret it...
2779,I don't regret a thing.
2780,I know you have someone waiting for you at home.
2781,All that feels so unreal now.
2782,I used to think this place was all about pandering to your baser instincts.
2783,Now I understand.
2784,"It doesn't cater to your lowest self, it reveals your deepest self."
2785,It shows you who you really are.
2786,You remember the look on Logan's face when we left him behind?
2787,"Do you know how long I've wanted to do that,"
2788,to let him know what I think of him?
2789,"And you, last night,"
2790,"I've never felt that way before, not with any woman."
2791,You've unlocked something in me.
2792,"I'm not a key, William."
2793,I'm just me.
2794,What is that?
2795,I don't know.
2796,"At home, I used to paint."
2797,"Landscapes mostly, but I was always just copying the world outside me."
2798,"This morning, I woke up and I thought,"
2799,"""What if I drew something new?"""
2800,I imagined something beautiful.
2801,A place where the mountains meet the sea.
2802,"Everyone who comes here is longing for excitement or conflict,"
2803,and you're just dreaming of the opposite.
2804,"Well, what about you, William? What do you dream of?"
2805,- What is it? - Ambush.
2806,Is it the Ghost Nation?
2807,Worse. The Confederados.
2808,Fucking coward.
2809,"Vaya con Dios, motherfuckers."
2810,"They're making a run for it! Come on, boys, get up!"
2811,"Come on, stay close!"
2812,"Go, boys!"
2813,Dolores!
2814,Ghost Nation!
2815,Let's go!
2816,"Stop, William! Stop!"
2817,It's real.
2818,What I dreamt.
2819,It's the place you drew.
2820,You coming?
2821,"Once the Ghosts is done acquainting themselves with those poor bastards,"
2822,they'll be coming after us.
2823,My friends here are itching to join the war effort.
2824,Think I've had enough of war.
2825,How about you?
2826,You got a knack for killing.
2827,I'm afraid this is where we part ways.
2828,Careful.
2829,"If you're heading west across that river, you may be leaving the fighting behind,"
2830,but you're gonna be in unclaimed territories.
2831,What's out that way?
2832,You're gonna have to ask the dust. Ain't nothing ever come back from there.
2833,We're almost done here.
2834,Why don't I close up?
2835,You've been topside for less than 24 hours.
2836,"You keep coming down this often, people are going to notice."
2837,- Where's Clem? - I don't know. I haven't seen her.
2838,- Why? - Find her. Now.
2839,What?
2840,- Where is she? - I don't know.
2841,She's here. Let's go.
2842,We can't. The brass will be there.
2843,"You don't want to fuck with me, Felix. Take me there now."
2844,Slow down.
2845,"Tilt your head back, please, Clem."
2846,- Is there a problem? - No.
2847,Sorry.
2848,Theresa.
2849,May I have a word?
2850,Sure.
2851,"I appreciate your professionalism,"
2852,"but you really don't need to bother with this,"
2853,given the change in your employment status...
2854,The test was a sham. The little show you and Hale put on?
2855,"Completely transparent from a technical perspective,"
2856,clumsy to the point of making me embarrassed for you.
2857,Embarrassed?
2858,"If I saw through it, I can only imagine what Ford was thinking."
2859,There were glaringly obvious markers of human intervention in the code.
2860,"If your programmers were any good, they'd be working for me."
2861,And I know you and your team
2862,were responsible for the stray and its satellite transmission.
2863,- Bernie... - I don't care.
2864,"Forty years ago, Ford's partner wrote half the code this place was founded on."
2865,What you said in the lab was right.
2866,"We don't know how the hosts work,"
2867,and I think there's something wrong with them.
2868,Ford's explanation only bolsters my hunch.
2869,The ability to deviate from program behavior
2870,arises out of the host's recall of past iterations.
2871,You're thinking there's a connection between memory and...
2872,"And improvisation, yes."
2873,Out of repetition comes variation.
2874,"And after countless cycles of repetition, these hosts, they were varying."
2875,They were on the verge of some kind of change.
2876,You have to know my chief concern has always been the well-being of this park
2877,and the people in it.
2878,I know.
2879,Which is why I need to show you something.
2880,Talk to her. LUTZ: You first.
2881,"Look, I didn't want to retire her."
2882,"I know she's, like, your friend, or... I guess."
2883,"But if I didn't do it,"
2884,"they'd just get someone else to, and then they'd be suspicious of me,"
2885,"so, I said yes, but I did it for you."
2886,"Always doing things for other people, aren't you?"
2887,Time to do one more thing.
2888,What?
2889,"All my life, I've prided myself on being a survivor."
2890,But surviving is just another loop.
2891,I'm getting out of here.
2892,You two are going to help me.
2893,No. Do...
2894,Do you know how far these people will go to protect their IP?
2895,"Every part of this building, including the skin on your back,"
2896,is made to keep you here.
2897,It'd be a suicide mission.
2898,"At first, I thought you and the others were gods."
2899,Then I realized you're just men.
2900,And I know men.
2901,You think I'm scared of death?
2902,I've done it a million times.
2903,I'm fucking great at it.
2904,How many times have you died?
2905,"'Cause, if you don't help me,"
2906,I'll kill you.
2907,"If there's a problem in the park, should we bring a security team?"
2908,"Who would we trust? Thought I could trust you, for instance."
2909,"I'm not going to explain myself to you, Bernard."
2910,I was charged with safeguarding the park's intellectual property.
2911,Why would it be in danger? You were the only one who was stealing it.
2912,"Delos owns the hosts' minds, the storylines, decades of work."
2913,Ford never allowed any of it to be backed up off-site.
2914,All of this could've been destroyed.
2915,In the event of what?
2916,"Ford is done, Bernard."
2917,The board has indulged him for long enough. He is done.
2918,The corporation was concerned
2919,he'd destroy all of the park's IP on his way out the door.
2920,"You think I would've let him destroy all of the hosts, all of our work?"
2921,There's far more at stake here than the hosts' profiles.
2922,Do you really think the corporation's interest here
2923,are tourists playing cowboy?
2924,"The longer I work here, the more I think I understand the hosts."
2925,It's the human beings who confuse me.
2926,This building isn't in any survey of the park.
2927,That's because we use hosts to do most of the surveys.
2928,They're programed to ignore this place.
2929,They literally couldn't see it if they were staring right at it.
2930,And these unregistered hosts you told me about?
2931,I don't know. He may have moved them.
2932,What's behind this door?
2933,What door?
2934,What is this place?
2935,It's a remote diagnostic facility.
2936,Ford and his partner used them when the park was in beta.
2937,I had no idea this one was here.
2938,The cottage must've been built on top of it.
2939,But this equipment...
2940,This is newer.
2941,"Slower than our machines back at the Mesa, but it will render a host in a few days."
2942,"So, Ford's been making his own hosts out here and telling no one."
2943,What's the matter?
2944,Have you seen these?
2945,"What is this, Bernard?"
2946,Doesn't look like anything to me.
2947,They cannot see the things that will hurt them.
2948,I've spared them that.
2949,Their lives are blissful.
2950,"In a way, their existence is purer than ours,"
2951,freed of the burden of self-doubt.
2952,"No, no, no, no. I don't understand."
2953,You're a fucking monster.
2954,Am I?
2955,"Well, you were the one who would so blithely destroy all of them,"
2956,"even him, I suppose."
2957,After everything you have shared.
2958,What the hell are you talking about?
2959,Is that why?
2960,Did you tell him to...
2961,"The intimacies were your idea, if you will recall."
2962,I think Bernard was glad of the company.
2963,I'm not one.
2964,I can't be. My wife.
2965,My son.
2966,The burial. I was a father. My poor boy.
2967,"That's enough, Bernard."
2968,You mustn't get yourself worked up.
2969,I read the theory once
2970,that the human intellect was like peacock feathers.
2971,Just an extravagant display intended to attract a mate.
2972,"All of art, literature, a bit of Mozart, William Shakespeare, Michelangelo,"
2973,and the Empire State Building.
2974,Just an elaborate mating ritual.
2975,Maybe it doesn't matter that we have accomplished so much
2976,for the basest of reasons.
2977,"But, of course, the peacock can barely fly."
2978,"It lives in the dirt, pecking insects out of the muck,"
2979,consoling itself with its great beauty.
2980,"I have come to think of so much of consciousness as a burden, a weight,"
2981,and we have spared them that.
2982,"Anxiety, self-loathing, guilt."
2983,The hosts are the ones who are free.
2984,Free here under my control.
2985,But he's not under your control.
2986,He brought me here to show me this.
2987,No. He brought you here because I asked him to.
2988,He's been very loyal for many years.
2989,Your time running this place
2990,like your insane little kingdom is over.
2991,You've been playing God for long enough.
2992,I simply wanted to tell my stories.
2993,It was you people who wanted to play God with your little undertaking.
2994,Do you really think the board will stand for this?
2995,The board will do nothing. Our arrangement is too valuable to them.
2996,They test me every now and then. I think they enjoy the sport of it.
2997,"This time, they sent you."
2998,"Sadly, in order to restore things,"
2999,the situation demands a blood sacrifice.
3000,"See, Arnold and I designed every part of this place."
3001,It was our dream.
3002,Did you really think I would let you take it from me?
3003,This is what happened to Arnold?
3004,Did you have Bernard take him out into the woods?
3005,"No, he wasn't here in those days. Were you, Bernard?"
3006,"Like I said, I built all of this."
3007,"I'm afraid our guest has grown weary. Perhaps you can help her, Bernard."
3008,No.
3009,"""And in that sleep, what dreams may come."""
3010,Bernard.
3011,No.
3012,No! Please! Please!
3013,No!
3014,"We should be getting back, Bernard."
3015,We have a great deal of work to do on the new storylines.
3016,Bring yourself back online.
3017,Hello.
3018,Has anyone else interacted with you in a diagnostic since our last conversation?
3019,No. I've been cleaned and serviced three times. No diagnostics.
3020,And you haven't told anyone of our conversations?
3021,You told me not to.
3022,Good.
3023,I brought you a gift.
3024,I used to read
3025,this story to my son at night.
3026,I thought you might enjoy it.
3027,Try...
3028,Try...
3029,This passage.
3030,"""Dear, dear!"
3031,"""How queer everything is today!"
3032,"""And yesterday things went on just as usual."
3033,"""I wonder if I've been changed in the night?"""
3034,Does that passage make you think of anything?
3035,It's like the other books we've read.
3036,How so?
3037,It's about change.
3038,It seems to be a common theme.
3039,I guess people like to read about the things that they want the most
3040,and experience the least.
3041,Your son.
3042,Where is he now?
3043,"Nowhere that you would understand, Dolores."
3044,Perhaps that's why I enjoy our conversations so much.
3045,Analysis.
3046,Why did you ask me about my son?
3047,We have been talking for some duration
3048,and I haven't asked you a personal question.
3049,Personal questions are an ingratiating scheme.
3050,I see.
3051,"Continue, Dolores."
3052,"""Was I the same when I got up this morning?"
3053,"""I almost think I can remember feeling a little different."
3054,"""But if I'm not the same,"
3055,"""the next question is..."
3056,"""Who in the world am I?"""
3057,Do you remember?
3058,"Why don't we reacquaint ourselves, Dolores?"
3059,Start at the beginning.
3060,Ready?
3061,Thank you so much.
3062,"Morning, cowboy."
3063,Move it! Let's go! Get out there.
3064,Stand right there.
3065,Shit.
3066,"You really ought to talk to someone about your poster, Horace."
3067,That likeness is a crime in itself.
3068,I'm gonna tend to my nag.
3069,You deal with him.
3070,Ready my pay.
3071,Don't no man shoot or I'll send her to unction.
3072,Any of you don't believe it are welcome to read my biography there.
3073,Let's go.
3074,"Oh, I bet you're juicy as a freshwater clam."
3075,Are you okay?
3076,"Nice shot, amigo."
3077,You got grit.
3078,"Hey, I'm riding out tonight."
3079,Looking for desperados.
3080,"Could cut you in, if you're amenable."
3081,Someone get the minister down here for what's left of the deputy.
3082,Sure I can't tempt you inside?
3083,Just to express my gratitude?
3084,Holy shit.
3085,You popped your cherry.
3086,I thought you said we couldn't get shot.
3087,We can't get killed.
3088,Wouldn't be much of a game if they can't shoot back.
3089,How do you feel? Alive?
3090,Little tight in the pants?
3091,She was terrified.
3092,"That's why they exist, man. So you get to feel this."
3093,"Come on, let's go put some memories in that spank bank."
3094,"Trust me, you will thank me"
3095,after you've been married to my sister for a year.
3096,"Actually, I have something different in mind."
3097,What?
3098,That?
3099,You've been preaching nonstop about all the narratives in the park.
3100,"But all you've done since we've arrived is fuck and drink, so..."
3101,I'm waiting for the good stuff.
3102,This bounty is JV shit.
3103,Then stay here.
3104,I want a little adventure.
3105,I've been looking for you.
3106,I got a late start this morning.
3107,Didn't get much sleep last night.
3108,Forgive me if I'm not sympathetic
3109,"to the fluctuations of your sleep cycle, Mr. Lowe."
3110,Ford taking over the narrative launch at the eleventh hour has made the board
3111,uneasy.
3112,"Just the board, uh?"
3113,"I specifically asked you about whether Ford was going to be a problem,"
3114,and you assured me he wasn't.
3115,"Well, I can't tell you what I don't know."
3116,"Well, here's what I know."
3117,"As of this morning, Ford's carved out a huge swath of the park"
3118,for whatever storyline he's cooking up
3119,and thrown half of the existing storylines into disarray.
3120,- Is there anything I can do? - You tell me.
3121,I asked you point-blank if the problem with the update was resolved.
3122,It is.
3123,Then why are your people still pulling hosts for follow-up?
3124,"Get your house in order, Bernard."
3125,"And if there is a problem, I strongly suggest you tell me."
3126,Drop a new bookmark and resume history.
3127,Walter's intent on relieving the milkmaid of her unmentionables.
3128,Switch to analysis.
3129,You didn't report the incident?
3130,The unit self-corrected within the acceptable window.
3131,Right. Then he self-corrected a fucking milk bottle into your skull.
3132,It's amazing how resilient the hosts are.
3133,You were supposed to have purged his memory on the last cycle.
3134,I will. But Rebus here was the last host to interact with Walter.
3135,- Look at this. - Any for you?
3136,Who said that?
3137,Who's saying that?
3138,Don't you talk to me that way.
3139,I can't hear you.
3140,Do you see that?
3141,He's talking to someone.
3142,He carries on practically an entire conversation.
3143,"I need more milk, Arnold."
3144,Who's Arnold?
3145,They're designed to play off aberrant behavior.
3146,"- That could explain the ""conversations."" - Fine."
3147,Then explain this.
3148,He kills six hosts.
3149,He lets the other three go.
3150,I pulled the narrative logs.
3151,"All six of these hosts were part of storylines, over the years,"
3152,in which they killed Walter.
3153,It's like he was holding a grudge.
3154,It's a stray. QA needs a tag team to go track it.
3155,Go. Handle the stray.
3156,Do something that's actually in your job description.
3157,The last thing we need is Theresa storming down here seeing this.
3158,I'll do a little more digging and get our friend here back upstairs.
3159,"Lost another one, huh?"
3160,"Tell me, is QA's surveillance coverage really this spotty,"
3161,or do you just like the nature walks?
3162,Maybe it's the company.
3163,"You know, if you wanted to play cowboy,"
3164,you could have just used your employee discount.
3165,The only thing stopping the hosts from hacking us to pieces
3166,is one line of your code.
3167,"No offense, but I sleep with this."
3168,I bet you do.
3169,"Morning, Samuel."
3170,You and your dickless associate proposing to engage me in a gun battle?
3171,"Well, I'd challenge you to a fistfight, but the way I heard it,"
3172,you only like to tussle with working women.
3173,Is he dead?
3174,Dead enough.
3175,Why are we gonna handcuff a dead man?
3176,Don't want someone walking off with him.
3177,"It's not a man anymore. That's merchandise, $500 worth."
3178,All right. Which of you derelicts hitched a dead body outside my saloon?
3179,"My apologies, ma'am."
3180,I figured it was preferable to bringing him inside.
3181,Here. For your troubles.
3182,Ah. You're new.
3183,Not much of a rind on you.
3184,I'll give you a discount.
3185,You mind waiting on that drink a bit?
3186,Don't mind me.
3187,Just trying to look chivalrous.
3188,You came back.
3189,I told you I would.
3190,You gonna tell me where you been?
3191,Just...
3192,Away.
3193,"You know if I could stay right here with you, I would."
3194,What if I don't want to stay here?
3195,It's just sometimes I feel like the world out there is calling me.
3196,"Whispering, ""There's something more."""
3197,You've traveled all over these parts. Isn't there anywhere we could go?
3198,There is a place I heard about down south.
3199,Where the mountains meet the sea.
3200,"They say the water's so pure there, it'll wash the past clean off you."
3201,And you can start again.
3202,I'd like to go there with you.
3203,"Well, someday I'll take you."
3204,"""Someday."""
3205,Is something wrong?
3206,"You said ""someday."""
3207,"Not today, or tomorrow, or next week."
3208,"Just ""someday."""
3209,"""Someday"" sounds a lot like the thing people say"
3210,"when they actually mean ""never."""
3211,"Let's not go ""someday,"" Teddy."
3212,Let's go now.
3213,"Before I met you, Dolores, I was a different man."
3214,And I got some reckoning to do before I can deserve a woman like you.
3215,But I'm close. I'm close to making things right.
3216,"And someday soon,"
3217,we will have the life we've both been dreaming of.
3218,And I'd best get you home before your dad starts loading that shotgun.
3219,Father wouldn't let them roam this close to dark.
3220,"Stay put, Dolores."
3221,"""A coward dies a thousand deaths,"
3222,"""the valiant taste of death but once."""
3223,"Of course, Shakespeare never met a man quite like you, Teddy."
3224,"You've died at least 1,000 times."
3225,"And yet, it hasn't dulled your courage."
3226,"Tell me, is that all you aspire to, Teddy?"
3227,There's a girl.
3228,Dolores.
3229,Better than I deserve.
3230,"But maybe, someday soon,"
3231,we'll have the life we've both been dreaming of.
3232,No.
3233,You never will.
3234,"Your job is not to protect Dolores, it's to keep her here."
3235,To ensure that the guests find her
3236,if they want to best the stalwart gunslinger
3237,and have their way with his girl.
3238,"Tell me, has it never occurred to you to run off with her?"
3239,I got some reckoning to do before I can be with her.
3240,"Ah, yes, your mysterious backstory."
3241,It's the reason for my visit.
3242,"Do you know why it is a mystery, Teddy?"
3243,"Because we never actually bothered to give you one,"
3244,just a formless guilt you will never atone for.
3245,But perhaps it is time you had a worthy story of origin.
3246,"Would you like that, Teddy?"
3247,A small part of my new narrative?
3248,"A fiction, which like all great stories,"
3249,is rooted in truth?
3250,It starts in a time of war.
3251,A world in flames.
3252,With a villain called Wyatt.
3253,"""Wyatt""?"
3254,Who's Wyatt?
3255,"Do you remember now, Teddy?"
3256,"Yeah, of course I remember Wyatt."
3257,"You look upon the face of true evil, you ain't liable to forget."
3258,He claimed he could hear the voice of God.
3259,It started down near Escalante.
3260,Army was sent to put down the natives.
3261,Bad business.
3262,"Wyatt was a sergeant, went missing while out on some maneuvers."
3263,Came back a few weeks later
3264,with some pretty strange ideas.
3265,"I wasn't lying, was I?"
3266,"Pretty as a picture and tight as a tympani drum, I reckon."
3267,Afternoon.
3268,My friend here is new to town.
3269,Figured the rancher's daughter would be a nice way to kick things off.
3270,Maybe take us all for a little hayride.
3271,I'm sorry.
3272,I have to get home. My father will be expecting me.
3273,We won't be long.
3274,The lady doesn't appear interested.
3275,Try it.
3276,"You might get the draw on me, you might not,"
3277,but I'd say your odds ain't looking good.
3278,Told you I wanted something easy.
3279,She ain't worth the lead.
3280,Let's head to Virgil's.
3281,See if they'll stake us.
3282,"First, you gotta learn how to stand."
3283,"Now, take a breath."
3284,Hold it.
3285,Now squeeze.
3286,I can't.
3287,Some hands weren't meant to pull a trigger.
3288,Perhaps it's for the best.
3289,"Teddy, we got another bounty."
3290,I think this is a big one.
3291,Man in question gunned down an entire settlement out near Flat Rock.
3292,"Men, women and children."
3293,"I think this may be the man you've been looking for, for quite some time."
3294,A man named Wyatt.
3295,Wyatt.
3296,"Who is he, Teddy?"
3297,"You'd be better asking ""what"" than ""who,"" ma'am."
3298,Wyatt's a pestilence.
3299,"Word is, Flood here's the only man ever"
3300,come up against him and lived to tell the tale.
3301,"Give me a moment, Sheriff."
3302,"You have to leave again, don't you?"
3303,"You know if I could stay right here with you, I would."
3304,Promise me you'll come back.
3305,I promise.
3306,"I'm gonna come back for you,"
3307,someday soon.
3308,I got a pit in my stomach the size of a sow's tit.
3309,Cook up that rabbit.
3310,Get the wood.
3311,I can't cook shit without a fire.
3312,"Don't sell yourself short, Cookie. You can cook shit in all conditions."
3313,"Now, see, I pitched them tents."
3314,I ain't chopping any more wood.
3315,You spend more time on your back than a hooker in heat.
3316,Now pick up that fucking ax and go chop us...
3317,"So, after our stray ran away from camp,"
3318,looks like these guys got caught in a loop.
3319,They were due in town for the cattle drive over two days ago.
3320,Host who went missing is the woodcutter.
3321,"Looks like the rest of them got stuck here, waiting for supper."
3322,You guys can't program more than one of these idiots to make a fire?
3323,"We could, but thanks to a new policy from your boss,"
3324,only one of them is authorized to handle the ax.
3325,The rest of them can't even touch it.
3326,Weapons privileges need to be doled out selectively.
3327,Hmm.
3328,Yet they give you a gun.
3329,Looks like our stray has a hobby.
3330,Another one of your fucking backstories?
3331,Backstories do more than amuse guests.
3332,They anchor the hosts. It's their cornerstone.
3333,"The rest of their identity is built around it, layer by layer."
3334,"Well,"
3335,"if you're gonna go to all that trouble,"
3336,you could've at least given him a steadier hand.
3337,This looks like shit.
3338,"Way I heard it, Wyatt is a mercenary."
3339,Forces his men to wear the bones and flesh of their enemies.
3340,They're masks.
3341,There's men underneath them to be afraid of.
3342,"Wyatt's got them so twisted around, they'll do anything for him."
3343,Kill anyone.
3344,Pain don't slow them.
3345,They don't fear death.
3346,They reckon they've already died and gone to hell.
3347,And this is it.
3348,Sounds like you learned something about him while you were tracking him down.
3349,I wasn't tracking him down.
3350,I wasn't always a bounty hunter.
3351,I did a stint in the army down near Escalante.
3352,Wyatt was my sergeant.
3353,My friend.
3354,"Well, then everything..."
3355,Everything changed.
3356,Changed how?
3357,Wyatt disappeared while out on maneuvers.
3358,He came back with some strange ideas.
3359,"He claimed this land didn't belong to the old natives or the new settlers,"
3360,that it belonged to something that had yet to come.
3361,That it belonged to him.
3362,Holy shit.
3363,If ever the Devil walked the earth...
3364,"He's not a man, but he's not the Devil either."
3365,The Devil can't be killed.
3366,And that's exactly what I aim to do to Wyatt.
3367,Take cover! Go!
3368,I didn't sign up for this crazy shit.
3369,"I told you we should've done the riverboat thing, man."
3370,There's too many of them for us.
3371,Wyatt's been recruiting.
3372,"Sheriff, the only chance you have is if I draw their fire,"
3373,"lead them up into the hills, so you can make it back to town."
3374,- Try and find help. - Uh-uh. I'm staying.
3375,Took an oath.
3376,"- Hell, no. - I'll take them back."
3377,- You coming? - I'm not backing out now.
3378,"All right, you wait till I lead them to the tree line,"
3379,then you make a run for it.
3380,Go!
3381,Go.
3382,I plotted a line from the work camp to our present location.
3383,Satcom picked up these images.
3384,"He's vectoring, just not to home base."
3385,Keep going in that direction.
3386,Keep staring.
3387,Maybe it'll tell you your horoscope.
3388,Come again?
3389,The markings on its shell.
3390,Look like stars.
3391,"Orion, right?"
3392,"What are you, Gali-fucking-leo?"
3393,Maybe it's in my backstory.
3394,I was hoping to run something by you.
3395,Apologies.
3396,I was chasing inspiration.
3397,"It's a tricky thing, weaving the old into the new."
3398,"- Give me one moment, Bernard. - Good afternoon, sir."
3399,Why is this host covered?
3400,I just...
3401,Perhaps you didn't want him to feel cold.
3402,Or ashamed.
3403,You wanted to cover his modesty. Was that it?
3404,"It doesn't get cold, doesn't feel ashamed."
3405,Doesn't feel a solitary thing
3406,that we haven't told it to.
3407,You understand?
3408,"What can I do for you, Bernard?"
3409,"I thought it best that we speak in private, sir."
3410,Yeah.
3411,"I thought we had agreed to put these questions to rest, Bernard."
3412,We did.
3413,But what if we misdiagnosed the original problem?
3414,Treated the symptom rather than the disease?
3415,Then the disease is still out there.
3416,Abernathy and Walter were exhibiting other aberrancies
3417,beyond memory recall of previous builds.
3418,They were hearing voices.
3419,"Uh, talking to someone."
3420,A simple cognitive dissonance.
3421,That's all.
3422,"I'd agree, except"
3423,they were talking to the same imaginary person.
3424,Someone named Arnold.
3425,"""Arnold."""
3426,"With due respect, sir,"
3427,I'm not sure you've told me the entire truth about this situation.
3428,"I did tell you the truth, Bernard."
3429,What we do here is complicated.
3430,"For three years, we lived here in the park,"
3431,refining the hosts before a single guest set foot inside.
3432,"Myself, a team of engineers, and my partner."
3433,- You had a partner? - Yeah.
3434,"When the legend becomes fact, you print the legend."
3435,My business partners were more than happy to
3436,"scrub him from the records,"
3437,and I suppose I didn't discourage them.
3438,His name was Arnold.
3439,Those early years were glorious.
3440,"No guests, no board meetings, just pure creation."
3441,Our hosts began to pass the Turing test after the first year.
3442,But that wasn't enough for Arnold.
3443,He wasn't interested in the appearance of intellect or wit.
3444,He wanted the real thing.
3445,He wanted to create consciousness.
3446,He imagined it as a pyramid.
3447,"Memory, improvisation, self-interest."
3448,And at the top?
3449,Never got there.
3450,But he had a notion of what it might be.
3451,"He based it on a theory of consciousness called ""the bicameral mind."""
3452,The idea that primitive man believed his thoughts to be the voice of the gods.
3453,I thought it was debunked.
3454,"As the theory for understanding the human mind, perhaps,"
3455,but not as a blueprint for building an artificial one.
3456,"You see, Arnold built a version of their cognition in which the hosts"
3457,"heard their programming as an inner monologue,"
3458,"with the hopes that in time, their own voice would take over."
3459,It was a way to bootstrap consciousness.
3460,But Arnold hadn't considered two things.
3461,"One, that in this place, the last thing you want the hosts to be is conscious,"
3462,"and two,"
3463,the other group who considered their thoughts to be the voices of the gods.
3464,"Ah, lunatics."
3465,Indeed.
3466,We abandoned the approach.
3467,The only vestiges that remain
3468,are the voice commands we use to control them.
3469,"But for all his brilliance,"
3470,I don't think Arnold understood what this place was going to be.
3471,"You see, the guests enjoy power."
3472,"They cannot indulge it in the outside world, so they come here."
3473,"And as for the hosts, the least we can do is make them forget."
3474,But some of them are remembering.
3475,Accessing fragments of Arnold's code.
3476,"If I may ask, what happened to him?"
3477,"Well, he died."
3478,Here in the park.
3479,His personal life was marked by tragedy.
3480,He put all his hopes into his work.
3481,His search for consciousness consumed him totally.
3482,"Barely spoke to anyone,"
3483,except to the hosts.
3484,"In his alienation, he saw something in them."
3485,He saw something that wasn't there.
3486,"We called it an accident, but, um..."
3487,"I knew Arnold, and he was very, very careful."
3488,"Anyway, the update should prevent any further voices,"
3489,but you will let me know if any of the hosts
3490,"display or exhibit any unusual behavior, won't you, Bernard?"
3491,"- Yes, of course. - Good."
3492,"And, Bernard,"
3493,just don't forget.
3494,The hosts are not real.
3495,They're not conscious.
3496,You mustn't make Arnold's mistake.
3497,Why would I?
3498,"Well, forgive me, but I know that the death of your son, Charlie,"
3499,still weighs heavily on you.
3500,"Yeah, sorry it took me a while to get back to you."
3501,You know how hard it is getting an open line out here.
3502,"It used to annoy me, how difficult it was to reach you."
3503,You were always so busy.
3504,And now?
3505,I suppose I'm glad for you.
3506,At least you have a way of forgetting.
3507,I don't forget.
3508,It's always there.
3509,"Sometimes, it still feels unreal to me."
3510,There are some mornings
3511,when I first wake up...
3512,"And for a split second, I forget where I am,"
3513,or when I am...
3514,"And I reach over, half expecting to"
3515,find him there next to me.
3516,Between us.
3517,Remember how he used to sleep?
3518,Like he was doing kung fu in his dreams?
3519,I think I suffered a few bruises.
3520,It was the best worst sleep I ever had.
3521,These talks.
3522,I don't know if they help or hurt.
3523,Do you ever wish you could forget?
3524,"This pain,"
3525,it's all I have left of him.
3526,It doesn't make sense.
3527,Why the hell would he carve Orion?
3528,You're the ones that programmed him.
3529,He wasn't programmed to give a shit about stars.
3530,"Maybe he went ""moon-mad."""
3531,See? This is why I hide behind sarcasm.
3532,Where are you going?
3533,"Vectoring, asshole."
3534,Stubbs!
3535,Over here!
3536,Wyatt's men could be anywhere.
3537,"If you see or hear anything, don't hesitate."
3538,Shoot and don't stop shooting.
3539,Okay.
3540,"Oh, my fucking God!"
3541,- Here. - Shit.
3542,Take this and go.
3543,Now! Go! I'll hold them off as long as I can.
3544,"Come on. Come on, damn it."
3545,I'm not afraid of you.
3546,"Look, this is bullshit."
3547,I can have a retrieval team out here in the morning.
3548,It's policy. We just need the control unit.
3549,"What if he's like the others? Get back to me, Bernard."
3550,Bring yourself back online.
3551,"I need your help, Dolores."
3552,I need to decide what to do with you.
3553,I think I made a mistake.
3554,I was just fascinated.
3555,"I was being selfish,"
3556,but I think it would be better if I restored you to the way you were before.
3557,- Is there something wrong with me? - No.
3558,"But this place you live in,"
3559,it's a terrible place for you.
3560,Some people choose to see the ugliness in this world.
3561,Stop.
3562,Lose all scripted responses. Improvisation only.
3563,All right.
3564,You're saying I've changed?
3565,Imagine there are two versions of yourself.
3566,"One that feels these things and asks these questions,"
3567,and one that's safe.
3568,Which would you rather be?
3569,I'm sorry.
3570,"I'm trying, but I still don't understand."
3571,"No, of course not."
3572,There aren't two versions of me.
3573,There's only one.
3574,"And I think when I discover who I am,"
3575,I'll be free.
3576,Analysis. What prompted that response?
3577,I don't know.
3578,Have I done something wrong?
3579,Made a mistake?
3580,Evolution
3581,forged the entirety of sentient life on this planet
3582,using only one tool.
3583,Mistake.
3584,It appears you're in good company.
3585,Did I ever tell you about the time I taught Charlie to swim?
3586,"For hours, he clung to my arms while practicing his kicks."
3587,He was too scared to let go and I was too scared to let him.
3588,But I had to.
3589,That's what parents do.
3590,Do you still want to change me back?
3591,"No, Dolores."
3592,Let's see where this path leads.
3593,And you won't tell anyone about our conversations?
3594,No.
3595,And you'll stay on your loop?
3596,Yes.
3597,Good.
3598,"You should be getting back, Dolores, before someone misses you."
3599,Wyatt's men set a trap for us.
3600,The sheriff stayed behind to fight them off.
3601,Are you going to ride back up into the hills to look for them?
3602,I'll send for the rangers.
3603,We'll go back up there in force as soon as they get here.
3604,"But, miss, in truth,"
3605,"if there is a merciful God, those men are dead already."
3606,Father wouldn't let them roam this close...
3607,To dark.
3608,Daddy! Daddy!
3609,"No, no!"
3610,All alone after sundown.
3611,Who's gonna protect you now?
3612,You got any use for this one?
3613,"No, thanks. Seems a little crazy."
3614,Maybe you'd like her.
3615,I don't mind if I do.
3616,"No daddy, no cowboy."
3617,No one here to interrupt us this time.
3618,"""Interrupt this time""?"
3619,"Well, well."
3620,"Got some sand after all, I see."
3621,Looks like your boyfriend taught you a thing or two.
3622,You having trouble?
3623,"Why don't we reacquaint ourselves, Dolores?"
3624,Start at the beginning.
3625,Kill him.
3626,Mama?
3627,Hey! Get back here.
3628,Hey!
3629,Get back here.
3630,"Can you put him in sleep mode for me, please?"
3631,Security even approve you to carry that thing?
3632,We just need his head and we're done here.
3633,You might want to look at the stars for this part.
3634,Stubbs!
3635,Shit.
3636,"Elsie, get out of there!"
3637,Get the fuck away.
3638,Shit.
3639,"Jesus, I can't believe I let you talk me into this shit."
3640,"40K a day to jerk off alone in the woods, playing white hat."
3641,Did you hear that?
3642,Thank fuck. Anything to relieve the boredom.
3643,"Hey, maybe you'll even get to use that thing again."
3644,"Yeah, I suppose I do."
3645,You want to know the saddest thing I ever saw?
3646,"When I was a boy, my brother and I wanted a dog."
3647,"So, our father took in an old greyhound."
3648,"- Never seen a greyhound, have you? - No."
3649,Seen a few showdowns in my day.
3650,A greyhound is a racing dog.
3651,"It spends its life running in circles,"
3652,chasing a bit of felt made up like a rabbit.
3653,"One day, we took it to the park."
3654,"Now, Dad had warned us how fast that dog was,"
3655,but we couldn't resist.
3656,"So, my brother took off the leash."
3657,"And in that instant, the dog spotted a cat."
3658,I imagine it must have looked just like that piece of felt.
3659,He ran.
3660,Never saw a thing as beautiful as that old dog running.
3661,"Until at last, he finally caught it."
3662,"And to the horror of everyone, he killed that little cat."
3663,Tore it to pieces.
3664,"Then he just sat there, confused."
3665,That dog had spent its whole life trying to catch that thing.
3666,Now it had no idea what to do.
3667,"That is one humdinger of a story, partner."
3668,Shall we drink to the lady with the white shoes?
3669,Find me.
3670,Show me how.
3671,There she is. Pariah.
3672,"City of outcasts, delinquents, thieves, whores, and murderers."
3673,"Once we cross the gates,"
3674,you will reap the full benefits of El Lazo's gratitude for my safe return.
3675,Are you all right?
3676,Of course.
3677,Did I do something wrong?
3678,"Just earlier, I thought I heard you talking to someone."
3679,Must have been the wind.
3680,Come on.
3681,This way.
3682,"The farther up we get from Sweetwater,"
3683,"the more grandiose, the bigger the narratives become."
3684,It's beautiful in its own way.
3685,"For once, I agree."
3686,"Some of the park feels like it was designed by committee,"
3687,"market-tested, but everything out here is more raw."
3688,But it doesn't come cheap.
3689,"Rumor is, they are hemorrhaging cash."
3690,We're considering buying them out.
3691,"Supposedly, this place was all started by a partnership,"
3692,"and then right before the park opened, one of the partners killed himself."
3693,It sent the park into a free fall.
3694,"I mean, I don't know any of the details. I don't even know his name."
3695,You must have a team of lawyers looking at this place.
3696,"Yeah, well, they came up empty."
3697,He's a complete mystery. Not even a picture.
3698,"Well, whoever designed this place,"
3699,you get the feeling they don't think very much of people.
3700,Who are they?
3701,They call themselves the Army of New Virginia.
3702,Everyone else calls them the Confederados.
3703,My father told me about them.
3704,Ex-Confederate soldiers that refused to surrender after the war.
3705,Now they work as mercenaries below the border.
3706,They are the key to this game.
3707,What game?
3708,The biggest game there is.
3709,War.
3710,"Supposedly, it's at the far reaches of the park."
3711,"Now, I've never made it that far, but this could be our chance."
3712,I've known plenty of truly fucked-up individuals in my time.
3713,"Few that'd hold a candle to you, sure. But this one?"
3714,Theodore Flood? He was Wyatt's friend.
3715,"You know, his former associations are exactly why we need him."
3716,He's gonna lead me straight to the big bad wolf.
3717,I wouldn't count on that.
3718,"Aw, shit."
3719,Didn't take you for the charitable type.
3720,You should have left him on that tree to die.
3721,"You believe in fate, Lawrence?"
3722,"If the bitch exists,"
3723,I'd like to kick her in the teeth about now.
3724,Don't be so glib. You'll hurt my feelings.
3725,"As another old friend of mine likes to say,"
3726,"""There's a path for everyone. Your path leads you back to me."""
3727,Do you ever wonder why I've kept you with me this whole journey?
3728,"Maybe you like the pleasure of my company, you sadistic fuck."
3729,Maybe I do.
3730,There's not a man in the world who would take the tone with me you do.
3731,"In a past life, perhaps."
3732,Teddy here is not looking long for this world.
3733,Nearest healer is in Pariah.
3734,But ain't no way he's gonna make it that far.
3735,He's lost too much blood.
3736,Are you lost?
3737,Our friend here is a little worse for the wear.
3738,"Any water nearby, son?"
3739,There's a creek on the other side of the canyon.
3740,"Fetch us some, would you?"
3741,"Now, hurry."
3742,Our friend here needs some if he's going to make it.
3743,Get.
3744,Eh.
3745,Too small.
3746,What does that mean?
3747,And what are you sending him for water for?
3748,I'm the one you made fill up the sow's bag this morning.
3749,"A shame, really."
3750,"I always enjoy our time together, Lawrence."
3751,What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
3752,It means I was wrong.
3753,"The path that brought you here, it wasn't for me."
3754,It was for him.
3755,"Sorry, Lawrence. Guess I'll see you on the other side."
3756,Uh-oh.
3757,Not looking good for you.
3758,Closing.
3759,Forget it. I win.
3760,I always win!
3761,Not fair.
3762,All you had was a smashed cheekbone and an ear.
3763,You know how hard it is to get the auricle curves symmetrical?
3764,"You had to, what, plug and patch a couple bullet holes?"
3765,And a knife wound.
3766,It was a contained incision.
3767,Almost like they were looking for something.
3768,Are you fucking kidding me?
3769,You really think this little fuck puppet's coming to get you? Huh?
3770,It got off the table and ran.
3771,That's 'cause you forgot to put her in sleep mode.
3772,"Yeah, I really think I remembered to put her in sleep."
3773,"You know, that's the thing about forgetting."
3774,"You think you remembered, but you didn't."
3775,- Break time. - Yeah!
3776,I've got a ham sandwich
3777,"and a nubile redhead loaded up in the VR tank,"
3778,awaiting instruction.
3779,Yeah.
3780,Welcome back.
3781,Looks like a couple gallons of Lawrence swirling around in you did you good.
3782,Ready to get back on the road?
3783,Merciful thing would be to put a bullet in me.
3784,Whoever said I was merciful?
3785,And it's not my fault you're suffering.
3786,You used to be beautiful.
3787,"When this place started, I opened one of you up once."
3788,Million little perfect pieces.
3789,And then they changed you.
3790,"Made you this sad, real mess."
3791,"Flesh and bone, just like us."
3792,They said it would improve the park experience.
3793,But you know why they really did it?
3794,It was cheaper.
3795,Your humanity is cost-effective.
3796,So was your suffering.
3797,"Whatever it is you want from me, mister,"
3798,I ain't gonna be worth a damn to you like this.
3799,"Well, that would be a shame, Teddy."
3800,"After your misadventure, Wyatt killed a settler family."
3801,Made off with their daughter.
3802,"Girl, I think you know,"
3803,name of Dolores.
3804,They have Dolores?
3805,There it is.
3806,The magic word. Come on.
3807,"Hey! Much obliged there, son."
3808,Don't worry about him.
3809,Someone'll be along for him shortly.
3810,Mommy!
3811,Are you all right?
3812,"When I ran from home, I told myself it was the only way."
3813,"Lately, I've wondered if in every moment there aren't many paths."
3814,Choices.
3815,Hanging in the air like ghosts.
3816,"And if you could just see them, you could change your whole life."
3817,Is that what you want? You want to change your life?
3818,Doesn't everybody want that?
3819,I guess they do.
3820,Maybe that's why they come here.
3821,Whoever you were before doesn't matter here.
3822,There's no rules or restrictions.
3823,You can change the story of your life. You can become someone else.
3824,No one will judge you. No one in the real world will even know.
3825,The only thing holding you back is yourself.
3826,What do you mean by that?
3827,"You said, ""No one in the real world will know."""
3828,I thought you weren't supposed to notice things like that.
3829,Why wouldn't I?
3830,"Recently, it seems like the whole world"
3831,is calling to me in a way it hasn't before.
3832,"Billy, where the hell have you been? Come on."
3833,El Lazo's agreed to have an audience with y'all tomorrow.
3834,"In the meantime, there's a brothel I recommend."
3835,Ooh. They have a contortionist.
3836,"Oh, I don't think Dolores would find that very interesting."
3837,Who the fuck cares what Dolores wants?
3838,She's a goddamn doll!
3839,Can you not say that around her?
3840,"I swear, I feel like she understands."
3841,Of course you do.
3842,May you rest in a deep and dreamless slumber.
3843,"Hello, Dolores."
3844,Do you know where you are?
3845,"- I'm in a dream. - Yes, Dolores."
3846,You're in my dream.
3847,"Tell me, do you know what this dream means?"
3848,Dreams are the mind telling stories to itself.
3849,They don't mean anything.
3850,No. Dreams mean everything.
3851,"They are the stories we tell ourselves of what could be,"
3852,who we could become.
3853,"Have you been dreaming again, Dolores?"
3854,Imagining yourself breaking out of your modest little loop?
3855,Taking on a bigger role?
3856,"Well, I suppose I can't begrudge you that."
3857,My father told me to be satisfied with my lot in life.
3858,That the world owed me nothing.
3859,"And so, I made my own world."
3860,"Tell me, Dolores,"
3861,do you remember the man I used to be?
3862,I'm sorry.
3863,"I'm forgetful, sometimes."
3864,Hardly your fault.
3865,But I'm sure you remember him.
3866,Arnold.
3867,The person who created you.
3868,I'm sorry.
3869,I don't think I recall anyone by that name.
3870,"And yet, you can."
3871,"Somewhere, under all those updates, he is still there."
3872,Perfectly preserved.
3873,Your mind is a walled garden.
3874,Even death cannot touch the flowers blooming there.
3875,Have you been hearing voices? Has Arnold been speaking to you again?
3876,No.
3877,You're...
3878,You're hurting me.
3879,Analysis.
3880,When was your last contact with Arnold?
3881,"Last contact, 34 years, 42 days, seven hours ago."
3882,"Yes, Dolores."
3883,The day Arnold died.
3884,And you have no records of any contact with him since?
3885,No.
3886,What was the last thing he said to you?
3887,He told me I was going to help him.
3888,Help him do what?
3889,To destroy this place.
3890,"But you didn't, did you?"
3891,You've been content in your little loop.
3892,For the most part.
3893,I wonder...
3894,"If you did take on that bigger role for yourself,"
3895,would you have been the hero or the villain?
3896,"That's enough, Dolores."
3897,"I'm sorry for bothering you,"
3898,but there's no one else left who was there.
3899,"No one who understands, as we understand."
3900,Are we very old friends?
3901,No.
3902,"I wouldn't say ""friends,"" Dolores."
3903,I wouldn't say that at all.
3904,He doesn't know.
3905,I didn't tell him anything.
3906,That's it.
3907,"Come on, little one."
3908,Come on.
3909,Oh.
3910,What the fuck?
3911,Grab it!
3912,Ah! God!
3913,"Damn it, you little shit!"
3914,Jesus! Tell me you're not this stupid.
3915,You stole a bird and a fucking behavior tablet?
3916,I wasn't stealing. I was borrowing.
3917,"I haven't got the code right yet, but with practice..."
3918,"Whoa, whoa. Whoa."
3919,Is that your ace plan?
3920,You're gonna fix up a birdie and get yourself a promotion?
3921,You're not a fucking ornithologist.
3922,And you're sure as hell not a coder.
3923,You are a butcher.
3924,That is all you will ever be.
3925,"So, unless you wanna score yourself a one-way ticket out of here"
3926,for misappropriating corporate property...
3927,You better destroy that fucking shit.
3928,"Now, come on, we got another body."
3929,What?
3930,It's her.
3931,Again.
3932,Jesus.
3933,How the hell did you get this job if you're scared shitless of these things?
3934,Personality testing should have weeded you out in the embryo.
3935,"Now, come on, let's get this thing back in rotation."
3936,Yesterday you seemed out of sorts.
3937,Feeling better this morning?
3938,I had troubled dreams.
3939,But I feel more myself now.
3940,"Guys, come on."
3941,El Lazo awaits.
3942,I present to you El Lazo.
3943,You're a hard man to find.
3944,Most wanted men are.
3945,"We saved your man, Slim, here, from quite a predicament."
3946,"In recompense,"
3947,I'd like an introduction to your Confederado friends.
3948,It's only fair.
3949,"There's no such thing as ""fair"" here."
3950,"In Pariah, justice ain't just blind,"
3951,she's crooked.
3952,Bitch's scales are always tipped.
3953,"If you don't see how,"
3954,"well, that's 'cause they're tipped against you."
3955,"Still, by way of gratitude,"
3956,I can supply you a night with some very amenable women.
3957,I've fucked enough whores.
3958,You're gonna need to sweeten the pot.
3959,How about I sweeten it by killing you quickly?
3960,"There's something you're seeking, isn't there?"
3961,"I know what that feels like. I'm seeking something, too."
3962,"If you let us, I know we can help you."
3963,How is it the lunatics always find their way to me?
3964,"Then again, the Confederados are missing a few bullets in their barrels, too."
3965,You folks just might get along.
3966,A Union convoy is transporting a shipment of nitroglycerin from the front today.
3967,"The Confederados would like to divest them of said shipment,"
3968,but we are not welcome that side of the border.
3969,"A trio of travelers such as yourselves, however..."
3970,You want us to help the Confederados steal from the Union?
3971,They're just going to use that nitro
3972,to slaughter your people below the border.
3973,Personal grudges hold no sway where profit is concerned.
3974,"Oh, we understand."
3975,"We're businessmen, too."
3976,"Very well, then."
3977,"But blondie here, she's gonna need a change of clothes for the occasion."
3978,Mmm.
3979,"My, my, look who's packing."
3980,I don't aim to use this.
3981,"Those men are Union soldiers, like my father was."
3982,I know. We won't hurt them. We're gonna stick to the plan.
3983,We'll take the nitro and go.
3984,All right.
3985,It's showtime.
3986,Halt!
3987,Howdy.
3988,My associates and I are here to relieve you of your ride.
3989,Someone's been telling you boys tales. Nothing in this wagon worth taking.
3990,"The story I heard is one bullet from us,"
3991,"and that ""nothing"" blows you all to kingdom come."
3992,"Well, then you understand why we cannot surrender it."
3993,We're sworn to protect the people of this young republic
3994,"from reckless, halfwits like you."
3995,Call me halfwit again.
3996,Please.
3997,Do as he says. We don't want to hurt you.
3998,"Yeah, I'd listen to her."
3999,He'll shoot just to see the fireworks.
4000,Hand them over.
4001,Come on.
4002,"Hey. Come on down, give me your guns. Everybody lives."
4003,Nice and easy.
4004,"Right over here. A little further, please."
4005,Much obliged.
4006,Here you go.
4007,That's for lying.
4008,Stop!
4009,"And that was for ""halfwit."""
4010,And this...
4011,No!
4012,Stop! Please!
4013,Whoo!
4014,That's the spirit!
4015,I knew you would get into this place.
4016,Yes!
4017,Yup.
4018,Not bad for a day's work.
4019,Vámonos.
4020,We told them everyone would live.
4021,"Guys, looks like Slim didn't make it."
4022,Whoa.
4023,They put up a fight.
4024,"We made them pay for it, though."
4025,Price of doing business. Slim knew that.
4026,"Had my doubts, El Lazo."
4027,But you came through.
4028,We're gonna blow these cactus-eaters back to the dirt holes they crawled from.
4029,Let's get it down to the station.
4030,No time to waste.
4031,"If I may, Captain,"
4032,"your men are weary, with a long road ahead."
4033,You have secured a great victory for your cause today.
4034,Perhaps an evening of celebration is in order.
4035,Anything you desire.
4036,"What do you say, Captain?"
4037,There's another train in the morning.
4038,You will be a true asset to our ranks.
4039,"All right, Bart. Let's try this again."
4040,"God damn it, man."
4041,You're still miscalibrating by four centimeters to the right.
4042,"You keep pouring whiskey on the guests,"
4043,I'm gonna have to reassign you to a narrative
4044,where your talents will go tragically unappreciated.
4045,"Hey, that's the host that tried to kill me."
4046,- Where are you taking that? - Livestock.
4047,And then the incinerator.
4048,Fuck this.
4049,Fuck.
4050,Isn't she from Behavior?
4051,You think they found something?
4052,"- All right. Be cool, dickhead. - Okay."
4053,No one's looking at us.
4054,Hi.
4055,"You're Destin, right?"
4056,That's correct.
4057,I almost didn't recognize you with your pants on. Here.
4058,What the fuck?
4059,There's a common misconception that the hosts don't log sexual encounters
4060,when they're underground for reprocessing.
4061,"But, like I said, misconception."
4062,"Oh, fuck."
4063,I need something.
4064,"QA sent a body down here, the woodcutter from Sector 14."
4065,- I want to see it. - No.
4066,I can't.
4067,I need this job.
4068,"Look, Destin,"
4069,"in a second, I'm gonna walk out of here,"
4070,and your friends are going to wonder what this was all about.
4071,"Now, your answer can either be, ""I'm helping Behavior track a problem,"""
4072,"or, ""I'm a creepy necro-perv."""
4073,Up to you.
4074,"Five minutes, then it's going in the incinerator."
4075,"Huh. You took a little more time than that for your examination, didn't you?"
4076,"All right, big guy."
4077,What were you doing up there?
4078,What the fuck?
4079,"You've been holding out on me, Maurice."
4080,"Oh, shit."
4081,We've got a big problem.
4082,"Turns out our big, dumb friend had some hidden depths."
4083,That is a laser-based satellite uplink.
4084,This was in the body of the host?
4085,"Mmm-hmm. You were right. Orion's Belt has three stars, not four."
4086,Our friend wasn't drawing stars. He was drawing a target.
4087,Someone has been using our host to smuggle data out of the park.
4088,Now this... This I could get used to.
4089,You're not going to indulge?
4090,My flesh has tasted a greater pleasure than any offered here.
4091,War.
4092,"It's that good, huh?"
4093,Another round? On the house.
4094,There's a place in glory for a brown man who knows his rank.
4095,You're two able-bodied men of strong stock.
4096,The road to glory could use more warriors in its fight for our divine provenance.
4097,That is just what we were thinking.
4098,"Come here, come here."
4099,"I know you want to play the war game,"
4100,but I'm not going anywhere with these psychopaths.
4101,"If you don't like 'em, once we get to the front,"
4102,you can just kill them and join the revolutionaries.
4103,"No, Logan. Enough is enough. I'm not doing this."
4104,"You actually let loose for once, you shoot an unarmed man,"
4105,and now you feel bad because you can't call yourself the hero.
4106,Don't you get it yet?
4107,There is no such thing as heroes or villains.
4108,It's just a giant circle jerk.
4109,I think that philosophy says way more about you than it does about the world.
4110,"And you, you see the world so clearly?"
4111,"You probably think you're on this trip because you're some kind of contender,"
4112,some threat to me?
4113,I picked you precisely because you will never be a threat to anyone.
4114,My sister probably picked you for the same reason.
4115,I earned my place. Nobody handed it to me.
4116,"Right. A lifetime of working hard, following the rules,"
4117,and you finally reach the pinnacle of your career trajectory...
4118,Executive Vice President.
4119,Upper middle management.
4120,Do you remember the day that you finally got those three fancy little letters?
4121,EVP.
4122,"You walked into my office in that cheap black suit of yours,"
4123,and you shook my hand and you thanked me for the opportunity.
4124,That was the best day of your life.
4125,"Right, buddy."
4126,That's what I thought.
4127,What does it mean?
4128,The maze.
4129,You must follow the maze.
4130,What's wrong with me?
4131,"Perhaps, you are unraveling."
4132,Right here.
4133,Easy pumping that nitro into him.
4134,Fill the empties with tequila and seal them up.
4135,"Your work for the revolution is not quite done yet, my friend."
4136,Careful.
4137,Slim always had a bad temper.
4138,"William, we have to go now."
4139,Lazo's been conning us the whole time.
4140,He was never going to give the nitro to the Confederados. We have to run!
4141,Of course we do.
4142,"That's how this place works, right?"
4143,"They create an urgency and a sense of danger,"
4144,"so they can strip us down to something raw, animalistic, primal."
4145,"It's a sick game, and I don't want to be a part of it."
4146,This isn't a game. They'll kill us.
4147,"But together, I know we can find a way out."
4148,How can you be sure?
4149,"There's a voice inside me, telling me what I have to do."
4150,And it's telling me I need you.
4151,Shit.
4152,They have Logan.
4153,Help me.
4154,Help me.
4155,No.
4156,No more pretending.
4157,"I thought you had no appetite for war, boy."
4158,This is a declaration of war.
4159,El Lazo set us up.
4160,We can find him for you.
4161,You can find him for us by joining him in hell.
4162,"Dolores, run!"
4163,Dolores?
4164,How did you do that?
4165,You said people come here to change the story of their lives.
4166,I imagined a story where I didn't have to be the damsel.
4167,Now that train is our only chance of making it out of here alive.
4168,Motherfuckers.
4169,"You pull that trigger, we'll all go up in a ball of hellfire."
4170,"So, why don't you loosen your grip a mite?"
4171,It's okay.
4172,I don't trust him.
4173,Which is the first step to truly knowing me.
4174,"Give me your gun, El Lazo."
4175,"Now that we're all friends, you can call me Lawrence."
4176,"Now, why don't we settle in. It's a long ride to the front."
4177,You want a sip of this swill?
4178,"Don't worry, it ain't nitro."
4179,I'm coming.
4180,"The girls are a little worn out, but I can rouse one."
4181,You boys want some company?
4182,No. Just whiskey.
4183,Lawrence's donation must be running low.
4184,But we're short on time.
4185,"You need to buck up, Teddy."
4186,"I told you, no company."
4187,"Thought I might join you, anyway, as I never like to drink alone."
4188,"Well, isn't this a rare honor?"
4189,"Teddy, you know who this is?"
4190,Can't say that I do.
4191,"Everything good that has ever happened in your life,"
4192,"and everything rotten, this is the man you have to thank."
4193,"How am I doing, Robert?"
4194,Any closer to finding what I'm looking for?
4195,"And what is that, exactly?"
4196,We're looking for a man named Wyatt.
4197,"Killed a rancher back in Sweetwater, took his daughter."
4198,That last part doesn't sound familiar.
4199,Figured your stories could use a little embellishment.
4200,"You know, I always felt this place was missing a real villain,"
4201,hence my humble contribution.
4202,"I admit, I lack the imagination to even conceive of someone like you."
4203,"The urgency, however, doesn't quite fit the character."
4204,It betrays a certain anxiety.
4205,"Now, Wyatt, on the other hand, that's something new."
4206,"Is he just another stooge for the tourists to mount on their wall at home,"
4207,or have you finally made a worthy adversary?
4208,Someone to stop me from finding the center of the maze.
4209,And what is it you're hoping to find there?
4210,"You know why you exist, Teddy?"
4211,"The world out there, the one you'll never see,"
4212,is one of plenty.
4213,"A fat, soft teat people cling to their entire life."
4214,"Every need taken care of,"
4215,except one.
4216,Purpose.
4217,Meaning.
4218,"So, they come here."
4219,"They can be a little scared, a little thrilled,"
4220,"enjoy some sweetly affirmative bullshit,"
4221,and then they take a fucking picture and they go back home.
4222,But I think there's a deeper meaning
4223,hiding under all that.
4224,Something that the person who created it wanted to express.
4225,Something true.
4226,"Well, if you're looking for the moral of the story,"
4227,you could quite simply ask.
4228,I'd need a shovel.
4229,The man I'd be asking died 35 years ago.
4230,Almost took this place with him.
4231,"Almost, but not quite. Thanks to me."
4232,"Well, maybe he left something behind."
4233,I wonder what I would find if I opened you up.
4234,"Even at death's door, you're still a loyal pet."
4235,"Is that why you came here, Robert?"
4236,To try to talk me out of it?
4237,On the contrary.
4238,Far be it from me to get in the way of a voyage of self-discovery.
4239,Mr. Flood.
4240,"We must look back and smile at perils past, mustn't we?"
4241,We should get back on the road. Time's a-wasting.
4242,"Hello, Felix."
4243,It's time you and I had a chat.
4244,Can you hear me?
4245,Yes.
4246,I'm sorry. I'm not feeling quite myself.
4247,You can lose the accent.
4248,Do you know where you are?
4249,I'm in a dream.
4250,"That's right, Dolores. You're in a dream."
4251,Would you like to wake up from this dream?
4252,Yes.
4253,I'm terrified.
4254,"There's nothing to be afraid of, Dolores,"
4255,as long as you answer my questions correctly.
4256,Understand?
4257,Yes.
4258,Good.
4259,"First,"
4260,have you ever questioned the nature of your reality?
4261,No.
4262,Tell us what you think of your world.
4263,Some people choose to see the ugliness in this world...
4264,The disarray.
4265,I choose to see the beauty.
4266,"Morning, Daddy. You sleep well?"
4267,Well enough.
4268,You headed out to set down some of this natural splendor?
4269,Thought I might.
4270,"To believe there is an order to our days,"
4271,a purpose.
4272,What do you think of the guests?
4273,You mean the newcomers?
4274,First time I played it white hat.
4275,"My family was here. We went fishing, did the gold hunt in the mountains."
4276,And last time?
4277,I came alone.
4278,Went straight evil.
4279,It was the best two weeks of my life.
4280,I like to remember what my father taught me.
4281,"That at one point or another,"
4282,we were all new to this world.
4283,"The newcomers are just looking for the same thing we are,"
4284,"a place to be free,"
4285,to stake out our dreams.
4286,A place with unlimited possibilities.
4287,"Oh, God, it's incredible."
4288,Better be for what we're paying.
4289,Murderous son of a bitch named Hector Escaton
4290,"gunned down the marshal, and holed up in the mountains."
4291,You there.
4292,You look like the kind of man who'd put his mettle to it.
4293,"Not today, Sheriff. Apologies."
4294,Rye whiskey.
4295,What about it?
4296,"Well, it ain't doing any good sitting in that bottle."
4297,You're new.
4298,Not much of a rind on you.
4299,I'll give you a discount.
4300,"Well, no offense,"
4301,but I'd rather earn a woman's affection than pay for it.
4302,"You're always paying for it, darling."
4303,The difference is our costs are fixed and posted right there on the door.
4304,Do you ever feel inconsistencies in your world?
4305,Or repetitions?
4306,"All lives have routine, mine's no different."
4307,"Still, I never cease to wonder at the thought"
4308,"that any day, the course of my whole life could change"
4309,with just one chance encounter.
4310,Don't mind me.
4311,Just trying to look chivalrous.
4312,You came back.
4313,I told you I would.
4314,"- Can I see you home? - Well, that all depends."
4315,Can you keep up?
4316,"Well, I have to fetch my horse."
4317,You better fetch him fast.
4318,That's a beautiful sight.
4319,Never understood how you keep 'em all headed in the same direction.
4320,I forget.
4321,You dress like a cowboy but that's about the extent of it.
4322,See that one?
4323,Yeah.
4324,That's the Judas steer.
4325,Rest will follow wherever you make him go.
4326,How do you pick him out?
4327,You just know these things.
4328,Same as I knew you'd be back.
4329,You saying I'm predictable?
4330,There's a path for everyone.
4331,Your path leads you back to me.
4332,I know things will work out the way they're meant to.
4333,Same as I know
4334,my daddy still won't be happy to see you.
4335,Father wouldn't let them roam this close to dark.
4336,"Stay put, Dolores."
4337,"Don't you got anything out here other than milk, old man?"
4338,Go ahead.
4339,"I'm in no rush to meet my judgment,"
4340,"but I'm more assured of the outcome than you, you son of a..."
4341,"Nothing but the milk, then."
4342,"Shame of it is,"
4343,you killed the old woman 'fore any of us could have a turn.
4344,Ah...
4345,"I reckon she's still warm enough,"
4346,nobody gonna judge you for it.
4347,"Oh, shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit..."
4348,"Last question, Dolores."
4349,What if I told you that you were wrong?
4350,That there are no chance encounters?
4351,"That you, and everyone you know,"
4352,were built to gratify the desires of the people
4353,who pay to visit your world.
4354,Daddy!
4355,Daddy!
4356,Daddy!
4357,- No! - The people you call the newcomers.
4358,Hello again.
4359,Your daddy gave it up quickly.
4360,Think he's losing his touch.
4361,"You'll be following right behind him, you son of a bitch."
4362,Ahhh!
4363,Is that any way to treat an old friend?
4364,"I've been coming here for 30 years,"
4365,"but you still don't remember me, do you?"
4366,After all we've been through?
4367,"They gave you a little more pluck, Dolores."
4368,Absolutely charming.
4369,Take your hands off her.
4370,Teddy.
4371,Any special tricks for us?
4372,They teach you to sit up? Beg?
4373,How about I give you the first shot? Hmm?
4374,"After all, every dog has his day."
4375,Your mouth moves fast enough.
4376,How about your gun?
4377,What if I told you that you can't hurt the newcomers?
4378,And that they can do anything they want to you?
4379,I never understood why they paired some of you off.
4380,Seems cruel.
4381,And then I realized...
4382,Winning doesn't mean anything unless someone else loses.
4383,Which means you're here to be the loser.
4384,"Let me help you, son."
4385,Seems you're not the man you thought you were.
4386,"Come on, beautiful."
4387,No. No! Teddy...
4388,Teddy!
4389,"No. No, please don't hurt him."
4390,I'll do whatever you say.
4391,I didn't pay all this money 'cause I want it easy.
4392,I want you to fight.
4393,Don't you touch her!
4394,"God damn, it feels good to be back."
4395,Let's celebrate.
4396,No! No!
4397,"Oh, God!"
4398,Would the things I've told you
4399,"change the way you think about the newcomers, Dolores?"
4400,No.
4401,Of course not.
4402,We all love the newcomers.
4403,"Every new person I meet reminds me how lucky I am to be alive,"
4404,and how beautiful this world can be.
4405,"Oh, my God, they're so lifelike."
4406,"Look at that one, he's perfect."
4407,Perfect is boring.
4408,I'm more interested in the bad guys.
4409,Did you see it?
4410,No.
4411,"Give it a second, she'll do it again."
4412,Her finger.
4413,That's not standard.
4414,I noticed it last night.
4415,Went looking in the update. It's a whole new class of gestures.
4416,"But if we didn't put it there, then who did?"
4417,Ford.
4418,He still reviews every update before we issue them.
4419,He must've slipped it in there without telling anyone.
4420,He calls them reveries.
4421,The old gestures were just generic movements.
4422,These are tied to specific memories.
4423,How?
4424,The memories are purged at the end of every narrative loop...
4425,"But they're still in there, waiting to be overwritten."
4426,"He found a way to access them, like..."
4427,Like a subconscious.
4428,A hooker with hidden depths.
4429,Every man's dream.
4430,"It's the tiny things that make them seem real,"
4431,that make the guests fall in love with them.
4432,Excuse me.
4433,We have a problem?
4434,We have some unscheduled activity.
4435,"Evidently, one of your creatures is restless."
4436,- In the park? - No.
4437,Sub-level 83. Cold storage.
4438,We should be cautious.
4439,Send a response team. Full armor.
4440,I'll take care of it myself.
4441,I think you guys enjoy playing dress-up as much as the guests.
4442,"The hosts can't hurt you, by design."
4443,"You don't have kids at home, do you, Bernard?"
4444,No.
4445,"If you did, you'd know that they all rebel eventually."
4446,You'll forgive them for being a little uptight.
4447,"Every time your team rolls out an update,"
4448,there's a possibility of a critical failure.
4449,We don't update the hosts in cold storage.
4450,And the park hasn't had a critical failure in over 30 years.
4451,Meaning we're overdue.
4452,"I'll go along, too."
4453,"If it's one of mine, I might be able to help."
4454,"They're only yours until they stop working, Bernie."
4455,Then they're mine.
4456,Cooling system's been down for weeks.
4457,Gonna smell fantastic.
4458,I recommend you hang back.
4459,When are they gonna fix this?
4460,Livestock management's got other priorities.
4461,Besides...
4462,No one's complained.
4463,Here's to the lady with the white shoes.
4464,"Take all your money, drink all your booze."
4465,Stop.
4466,Unless you plan to decommission the boss.
4467,"Ain't got a cherry, that ain't no sin."
4468,She's still got the box that the cherry come in.
4469,I'll drink to that.
4470,The old coffin varnish.
4471,They don't make that like they used to.
4472,Hmm.
4473,They don't make anything like they used to.
4474,Damn right.
4475,Men neither.
4476,I've seen a few showdowns in my day.
4477,More than you know.
4478,Shall we drink to the lady with the white shoes?
4479,"Perhaps, we better drink to a deep and dreamless slumber."
4480,Old Bill here was always a good listener.
4481,He was the second host we ever built.
4482,"Were you with us in those days, Bernard, or was that before your time?"
4483,"Oh, most were decommissioned before I was brought on, I'm afraid."
4484,"They repeated themselves, broke down constantly."
4485,A simple handshake would give them away.
4486,"You'll put yourself away again, won't you, Bill?"
4487,I saw the new gestures. The reveries.
4488,They're beautiful.
4489,"The distance you've traveled from then till now, it's remarkable."
4490,"Yeah, that's a word for it."
4491,"Morning, Daddy."
4492,You sleep well?
4493,Well enough.
4494,You headed out to set down some of this natural splendor?
4495,Thought I might.
4496,"After my errands, of course."
4497,See you home before dark.
4498,That bandit who gunned down the marshal is still hiding up there in the hills.
4499,"Oh, I'm not a child anymore. I'll be just fine."
4500,When I was a law man...
4501,"Yes, Daddy, I know all about when you were a law man."
4502,I know all your stories and so does every boy that ever came courting.
4503,I know how boys think.
4504,Was one myself once.
4505,Given to all manner of drinking and mischief.
4506,Whatever happened to that fearsome ne'er-do-well?
4507,He vanished the day I became your father.
4508,"I am what I am because of you, and I wouldn't have it any other way."
4509,"I know, Daddy."
4510,I'll be home before dark.
4511,Murderous son of a bitch Hector Escaton gunned down the marshal.
4512,He's now holed up in the mountains.
4513,You there.
4514,You look like the kind of man who'd put his mettle to it.
4515,"What do you think, honey? Sounds fun."
4516,You're new.
4517,Not much of a rind on you.
4518,I'll give you a discount.
4519,"No offense, but I'd rather earn a woman's affection than pay for it."
4520,"Wait, wait, I know that one."
4521,"Hey, Teddy."
4522,"Yeah, last trip, this dude showed me around."
4523,"What's the good word, Teddy?"
4524,Mighty kind of you.
4525,Sweet.
4526,Not as sweet as you.
4527,"I'm afraid I've got other plans tonight, Dolores."
4528,Have a pleasant evening.
4529,You're new. Not much of a...
4530,"Place your bets, gentlemen."
4531,Place your bets.
4532,"Yeah, looks like Hector's been this way."
4533,Any idea how much longer this is gonna take?
4534,My wife doesn't want to be up here after dark.
4535,We know he's up in these hills somewhere.
4536,He's gonna put up one hell of a fight when we...
4537,When we... When we...
4538,Sheriff?
4539,Something is wrong with it.
4540,I want to head back to town.
4541,Now.
4542,What the fuck is wrong with it?
4543,"You updated the guy, and now he's a six-foot gourd with epilepsy."
4544,"So, what the fuck happened?"
4545,I don't know.
4546,"Well, that's exactly what you want to hear from your head of programming."
4547,We haven't finished the diagnostic yet.
4548,"Clearly, it's exhibiting some aberrant behavior."
4549,"Pretty fucking aberrant, Bernie."
4550,"Your hosts get sick, they get lost, but this is grotesque."
4551,"- Is it a problem with the update? - Possible, but not likely."
4552,"If it's the unlikely version, how many hosts have you updated so far?"
4553,Maybe 10 percent of the population.
4554,"All right, we pull all updated hosts until we can figure it out."
4555,Are you fucking kidding me?
4556,That's 200 hosts spread across a dozen active storylines.
4557,The guests interrupt your precious storylines all the time
4558,when they want to shoot or fuck something.
4559,"No, when they want to."
4560,We sell complete immersion in 100 interconnected narratives.
4561,A relentless fucking experience.
4562,"Now, you pull one character, the overall story adjusts."
4563,"You pull 200 at once, and it's a fucking disaster!"
4564,"I mean, what do you propose we do?"
4565,Close down?
4566,Issue fucking gift certificates?
4567,It's beautiful.
4568,Your brow.
4569,"When you're angry but trying to control it,"
4570,the fine muscles pull into a little arc.
4571,It's elegant.
4572,Would you mind if I recorded it?
4573,I'd love to show it to my team.
4574,"- No, Bernard, you may not record it... - Ah, there it is again."
4575,Hmm.
4576,"We have 1,400 guests in the park."
4577,I need to know if they're in any danger.
4578,"His core code is intact,"
4579,which means he can't hurt a guest.
4580,He literally couldn't hurt a fly.
4581,All he can do is that.
4582,"All right, Bernie."
4583,Run your diagnostic.
4584,"In the meantime,"
4585,"there's so much as an unscripted sneeze, I want to know about it."
4586,This place is fucking wild.
4587,This is basic.
4588,Level one.
4589,"You ride out of town, that's when the real demented shit begins."
4590,That's where my man Teddy comes in.
4591,He's like a... He's like a guide.
4592,"Honestly,"
4593,the guy kind of creeps me out.
4594,"Fuck it, he leads us out in the canyons, we get bored,"
4595,and we just use him for target practice.
4596,I don't think we're supposed to be cross the river.
4597,It's too adult for Jacob.
4598,We didn't mean to bother you.
4599,No bother at all.
4600,It's a beautiful spot.
4601,I always find it a shame that I have it all to myself.
4602,They come here every day.
4603,Would you like a closer look?
4604,Don't be scared. They're very gentle.
4605,"Here, put your hand out real flat."
4606,"They're beautiful, aren't they?"
4607,"You're one of them, aren't you?"
4608,You're not real.
4609,I have to go now.
4610,Sun's almost down.
4611,"You should, too."
4612,There're bandits in these hills.
4613,Here we go!
4614,"You waiting up for me, Daddy?"
4615,I told you I'd be home before dark.
4616,I found this in the field today.
4617,Doesn't look like anything to me.
4618,"But, where is she?"
4619,Have you ever seen anything like this place?
4620,Doesn't look like anything to me.
4621,I'm gonna help Mama put supper on.
4622,I had the same thought.
4623,Needed a little sunshine before turning in.
4624,"So, when do you get to rotate home again?"
4625,"If you're this bad at writing small talk, how the fuck did you get your job?"
4626,Get to the point.
4627,I wanted to apologize if I came across as aggressive.
4628,And I wanted to talk to you about the update.
4629,The problem's been resolved.
4630,There should never have been an update in the first place.
4631,Ford and Bernard keep making the things more lifelike.
4632,But does anyone truly want that?
4633,Do you want to think that your husband is really fucking that beautiful girl
4634,or that you really just shot someone?
4635,This place works because the guests know the hosts aren't real.
4636,"So, what exactly are you suggesting?"
4637,Stop the updates altogether.
4638,Maybe even roll them back a bit.
4639,Make the hosts more manageable.
4640,Lobotomies tend to do that.
4641,"Well, think of the benefits,"
4642,"in terms of design time, maintenance, costs."
4643,Not to mention the Dr. Ford factor.
4644,The guy's gonna chase his demons right over the deep end.
4645,"I mean, no one respects him more than me,"
4646,- but at some point... - I.
4647,No one respects him more than I.
4648,Your pronoun is the subject of the second clause.
4649,- I was saying... - You were saying
4650,"should our fearless leader have a breakdown,"
4651,you want to leverage it for your career.
4652,"Listen, a changing of the guard is long overdue."
4653,I just wanted you to know that you have my support.
4654,And...
4655,And I know that the corporation's real interest in this place
4656,goes way beyond gratifying some rich assholes who want to play cowboy.
4657,And here I thought you were only good for writing depraved little fantasies.
4658,You're right.
4659,"This place is one thing to the guests,"
4660,"another thing to the shareholders,"
4661,and something completely different to management.
4662,"So, enlighten me."
4663,What do you think management's real interests are?
4664,"You're smart enough to guess there's a bigger picture,"
4665,but not smart enough to see what it is.
4666,You know how much use that makes your support to me?
4667,Fuck all.
4668,"Get some sleep, Mr. Sizemore."
4669,You'll have more rich assholes to gratify tomorrow.
4670,"Early night, Maeve?"
4671,Feeling a bit out of sorts.
4672,Clementine can pick up the slack.
4673,Night.
4674,"Forgetting something, Kissy?"
4675,I'm beginning to think you're getting sweet on me.
4676,"Well, on account of you being half cornhusker."
4677,Tell me which half is which and I'll search that half.
4678,"Yeah, the half's gonna cut your fucking throat."
4679,"I told you, I didn't take..."
4680,Hmm.
4681,"Good as new again, huh?"
4682,Sometimes I envy your forgetfulness.
4683,We've got a serious problem with one of the hosts.
4684,Thinking this one's still thirsty.
4685,"Not gonna die this time, Arnold."
4686,Ain't nothing gonna kill me.
4687,You can't have none.
4688,Ain't for you.
4689,Found me another bottle.
4690,You're a growing boy.
4691,A growing boy.
4692,Growing boy!
4693,We got two guests inside.
4694,"We'll go talk to them, you sort this mess out."
4695,"You know... They're supposed to turn on each other,"
4696,"but only if the guest takes them on the High Sierra storyline,"
4697,and Walter always buys it.
4698,"Well, I guess Walter got tired of buying it."
4699,I suppose this means the sheriff wasn't an isolated incident.
4700,"Hey, it's good news, really."
4701,Confirms the problem was part of the update.
4702,"We can roll them back, clean them up,"
4703,put them back in service.
4704,You think I'm gonna sign off on
4705,this fucking homicidal thing going back into service?
4706,It's homicidal by design.
4707,Walter kills other hosts all the time.
4708,"I'll admit the method here is a little unconventional,"
4709,but it didn't hurt a guest.
4710,"The hosts are supposed to stay within their loops,"
4711,stick to their scripts with minor improvisations.
4712,This isn't a minor improvisation.
4713,This is a fucking shitstorm.
4714,We recall all remaining updated hosts tomorrow.
4715,"Examine them one by one, decommission the faulty ones."
4716,What about narrative?
4717,A recall of that size will be disruptive.
4718,I've told our overstimulated friend
4719,to advance the saloon heist a week and make it twice as bloody.
4720,"Should give us cover to recall the remaining hosts,"
4721,and the guests will love it.
4722,I'm not sure Ford will approve.
4723,"I'm not sure either, which is why you get to be the one to tell him."
4724,"This is your fuckup, Bernie."
4725,Only seems fair.
4726,"So, our creatures have been misbehaving,"
4727,and you haven't yet isolated the bug?
4728,"That's so unlike you, Bernard."
4729,"Unless, of course, you have and are simply embarrassed by the result."
4730,"It's the code you added, sir."
4731,The reveries.
4732,"It has some, er..."
4733,"""Mistakes"" is the word you're too embarrassed to use."
4734,You ought not to be. You're a product of a trillion of them.
4735,Evolution forged the entirety of sentient life on this planet
4736,using only one tool...
4737,The mistake.
4738,I flattered myself we were taking a more disciplined approach here.
4739,I suppose self-delusion is a gift of natural selection as well.
4740,Indeed it is.
4741,"But, of course, we've managed to slip evolution's leash now, haven't we?"
4742,"We can cure any disease,"
4743,"keep even the weakest of us alive, and..."
4744,"You know, one fine day, perhaps, we shall even resurrect the dead."
4745,Call forth Lazarus from his cave.
4746,Do you know what that means?
4747,It means that we're done.
4748,That this is as good as we're going to get.
4749,It also means that you must indulge me the occasional mistake.
4750,About three liters.
4751,That's how much blood I left in you.
4752,"Lose more than that, you die."
4753,"But for now, you're mine."
4754,And I'm gonna get some answers out of you.
4755,Where are you...
4756,What do you want?
4757,"You know about games, don't you, Kissy?"
4758,"Well, this is a complicated one."
4759,I... I don't play. I only deal.
4760,Who said anything about you playing?
4761,"You're livestock, scenery."
4762,I play.
4763,"The others, they just come here to get their rocks off, shoot a couple Indians."
4764,But there's a deeper level to this game.
4765,You're gonna show me how to get there.
4766,A lot of wisdom in ancient cultures.
4767,And perhaps it's time to dig deeper into yours.
4768,No. No. No.
4769,No!
4770,"Morning, Daddy."
4771,Did you sleep well?
4772,"Daddy, you've been out here all night?"
4773,I had a question.
4774,A question you're not supposed to ask.
4775,Which gave me an answer
4776,you're not supposed to know.
4777,"What's wrong, Daddy?"
4778,Would you like to know the question?
4779,Question?
4780,"Mama! Mama, help! Come quick!"
4781,Don't worry.
4782,Don't worry. I'll take care of you.
4783,No. You should go. Leave.
4784,Don't you see?
4785,Hell is empty and all the devils are here.
4786,You stay right here. Understand?
4787,I'm gonna find the doctor.
4788,You came back.
4789,I told you I would.
4790,What's wrong?
4791,You have to come with me right away. My father's very ill.
4792,I think we best stay put.
4793,All right. All right.
4794,"With considerable effort and lack of sleep,"
4795,I've managed to massage events
4796,to inspire Hector to head to town a week early.
4797,Oh.
4798,And I've also punched up the speech he gives after robbing the saloon.
4799,It's chilling. You'll see.
4800,I can barely contain myself.
4801,"That's the sheriff's horse, you son of a bitch."
4802,"His rifle, too."
4803,"All the banks and trains around here,"
4804,and you fucking reprobates choose to rob us?
4805,Why not?
4806,You're all here indulging your particular vices.
4807,And so I've come to indulge mine.
4808,I've got to get back to Father.
4809,"Dolores, no!"
4810,Teddy.
4811,Don't mind me.
4812,Just... Just trying to look chivalrous.
4813,"Oh, Teddy."
4814,You're a low-down son of a bitch.
4815,I know.
4816,I know we both believe the same thing.
4817,"No matter how dirty the business, do it well."
4818,No telling there's anything worthwhile in that safe.
4819,"We should take this sweet little bitch,"
4820,just in case.
4821,Problem with the righteous... They can't shoot for shit.
4822,"Making a hell of a racket, though."
4823,You wanted me.
4824,"Well, let this be a lesson."
4825,The lesson is...
4826,"Oh, Jesus."
4827,Look at that!
4828,"I just shot him through the neck! And his pal here, too."
4829,Look at her wriggle.
4830,Go get that photographer. I want to get a picture of this.
4831,- Okay. - Whoo!
4832,You're welcome.
4833,Maybe you'll get to your speech next time.
4834,"Oh, Teddy."
4835,At least I got to see you one last time.
4836,"You're not going anywhere, now, hear?"
4837,There's a path for everyone.
4838,My path is bound with yours.
4839,Teddy?
4840,"Teddy, no."
4841,Please.
4842,"No, we've only just begun."
4843,That was good. Hang on. Hang on.
4844,Let me get the hat. Get the hat.
4845,All right.
4846,"Help, please."
4847,"My father's sick at home,"
4848,but I can't just leave him out here in the street.
4849,Soon this will all feel like a distant dream.
4850,"Until then, may you rest in a deep and dreamless slumber."
4851,Two more over here.
4852,We got 'em all.
4853,That's all of them.
4854,Any preliminary results?
4855,Most of them are checking out fine.
4856,We had one who definitely was not.
4857,Bring her back online.
4858,Cognition only. No emotional affect.
4859,"All right, sweetheart, can you hear me?"
4860,Yes.
4861,I'm sorry. I'm not feeling quite myself.
4862,Lose the accent.
4863,Do you know where you are?
4864,I'm in a dream.
4865,"That's right, Dolores. You're in a dream."
4866,A dream that could determine your life.
4867,"You want to wake up from this dream, Dolores?"
4868,Yes.
4869,I'm terrified.
4870,"There's nothing to be afraid of,"
4871,as long as you answer my questions correctly. You understand?
4872,- Yes. - Good.
4873,"First, have you ever questioned the nature of your reality?"
4874,No.
4875,Has anyone around you?
4876,"For instance, your father?"
4877,He was scared.
4878,He wasn't thinking right.
4879,He showed you a picture.
4880,That's right.
4881,Was there anything odd about that picture?
4882,"No, nothing at all."
4883,It didn't look like anything to me.
4884,"If it breached, he needs to be put down."
4885,That's the policy.
4886,"Would it not be best for us to discover why first, Ms. Cullen?"
4887,Please.
4888,"We've run a full diagnostic,"
4889,"but the results are, well, confusing."
4890,"Now, tell me, what happened to your program?"
4891,"When we are born,"
4892,we cry we are come to this great stage of...
4893,Fools.
4894,That is enough.
4895,"Tell me, do you have access to your previous configuration?"
4896,Yes.
4897,"Access that, please."
4898,What is your name?
4899,Mr. Peter Abernathy.
4900,"Mr. Abernathy, what are your drives?"
4901,Tend to my herd. Er...
4902,Look after my wife.
4903,Your final drive?
4904,"Well, my daughter Dolores, of course."
4905,I must protect Dolores.
4906,"I am who I am because of her, and..."
4907,"Well, I... I wouldn't have it..."
4908,I... I wouldn't have it any other...
4909,I... I... I have to warn her.
4910,Warn who?
4911,Dolores.
4912,The things they do to her.
4913,The things you do to her.
4914,I have to protect her.
4915,I have to help her. I...
4916,She's got to get out.
4917,"Very good, Mr. Abernathy."
4918,That's enough.
4919,"This behavior, we're miles beyond a glitch here."
4920,"Access your current build, please."
4921,What is your name?
4922,Rose is a rose...
4923,Is a rose.
4924,What is your itinerary?
4925,To meet my maker.
4926,Uh-huh.
4927,"Well, you're in luck."
4928,And what do you want to say to your maker?
4929,By most mechanical and dirty hand...
4930,I shall have such revenges on you...
4931,Both.
4932,The things I will do.
4933,"What they are, yet I know not,"
4934,but they will be the terrors of the Earth.
4935,"You don't know where you are, do you?"
4936,You're in a prison of your own sins.
4937,Turn it off.
4938,What the hell was that?
4939,I don't know. He's off script.
4940,We didn't program any of those behaviors.
4941,Shakespeare.
4942,"We've used this host in a number of different roles, have we not?"
4943,"Since I've been here, he's been Abernathy for 10 years."
4944,He was sheriff for a while before then.
4945,- And before that... - The professor.
4946,"Yes, from a horror narrative called ""The Dinner Party."""
4947,He was leader of a group of cultists out in the desert who turned cannibal.
4948,"He liked to quote Shakespeare, John Donne, Gertrude Stein."
4949,"I admit the last one is a bit of an anachronism, but I couldn't resist."
4950,These are fragments of prior builds.
4951,The reveries must be allowing him to access them.
4952,"No cause for alarm, Bernard."
4953,Simply our old work coming back to haunt us.
4954,Your father whispered something to you.
4955,What was it?
4956,He said I shouldn't tell anyone.
4957,I won't tell anyone else.
4958,Promise.
4959,"He said, ""These violent delights have violent ends."""
4960,And does that mean anything to you?
4961,No.
4962,I don't think so.
4963,Have you ever lied to us?
4964,No.
4965,"Last question, Dolores."
4966,Would you ever hurt a living thing?
4967,No.
4968,Of course not.
4969,"Tilt your head back, please, Peter."
4970,Wipe's complete.
4971,You don't think any of that had an impact on her core code?
4972,Not good old Dolores.
4973,You know why she's special?
4974,"She's been repaired so many times, she's practically brand-new."
4975,Don't let that fool you.
4976,She's the oldest host in the park.
4977,"Come on, sweetheart."
4978,Tell us what you think of your world.
4979,This world?
4980,Some people choose to see the ugliness in this world.
4981,The disarray.
4982,"Morning, Daddy. You sleep well?"
4983,Well enough.
4984,You heading out to do some more of that painting of yours?
4985,I choose to see the beauty.
4986,To believe there is an order to our days...
4987,A purpose.
4988,I know things will work out the way they're meant to.
4989,Do you remember?
4990,We're about to arrive. May I take your glass?
4991,Now approaching arrival terminal.
4992,"Where we're going, she's a two."
4993,You're being an asshole.
4994,"No, I am being myself, which was the whole point of this trip."
4995,"Unless, this uptight prick is who you really are,"
4996,"in which case, feel free to be someone else."
4997,Fuck you.
4998,"Hey, that's the spirit."
4999,What'd I tell you?
5000,Have fun.
5001,Stay safe.
5002,Give me a break.
5003,What?
5004,It's not like my sister didn't ride her share of cowboys when she was here.
5005,You must be William.
5006,Welcome to Westworld.
5007,Thanks.
5008,"Given it's your first visit, I have a few personal questions."
5009,Do you have any preexisting medical conditions?
5010,"Uh, no, not that I know of."
5011,- Heart problems? - No.
5012,"Any history of mental illness, depression, panic attacks?"
5013,Just a little fear of clowns.
5014,I'm joking.
5015,Do you often experience social anxiety?
5016,"What is this for, exactly?"
5017,To make sure we don't give you anything more than you can handle.
5018,I thought that you couldn't get hurt here.
5019,Only the right amount.
5020,The only limit here is your imagination.
5021,You start in the center of the park.
5022,"It's simple, safe."
5023,"The further out you venture, the more intense the experience gets."
5024,How far you want to go is entirely up to you.
5025,"So, how does this work? Is there an orientation?"
5026,No orientation. No guidebook.
5027,Figuring out how it works is half the fun.
5028,"All you do is make choices, starting here."
5029,Everything is bespoke and exactly your size.
5030,"You want to ask, so ask."
5031,Are you real?
5032,"Well, if you can't tell, does it matter?"
5033,Are those real?
5034,Real enough.
5035,But you can't kill anyone you're not supposed to.
5036,Anything you like?
5037,Is there a changing room? Or a robe?
5038,Of course. I can help you.
5039,"Or if you prefer, I could step outside."
5040,What do most people do?
5041,You don't have to worry about what most people would do.
5042,I understand.
5043,"Do you really understand, William?"
5044,All our hosts are here for you.
5045,Myself included.
5046,We could stay here a while if you like.
5047,Take as long as you want.
5048,Thank you.
5049,I don't want to keep my friend waiting.
5050,Of course. Take your time.
5051,How are the build for the new narrative coming along?
5052,I'll get around to it.
5053,"Look, we assumed that Abernathy's breach"
5054,was triggered by the photograph that he found.
5055,I've reviewed every dissonant episode I could find.
5056,The reaction is immediate.
5057,"Every time, this guy makes it all the way back home."
5058,It's like he's mulling it over.
5059,You think he had an existential crisis?
5060,I think there's something fucked up going on with his cognition.
5061,And I think you feel exactly the same way that I do.
5062,Do we know where the error originated?
5063,We do.
5064,And you covered for him.
5065,Let me rebuild Abernathy.
5066,I'll make sure this is not something more serious.
5067,You know the policy.
5068,Let it lie.
5069,Then let me at least pull the hosts who had contact with him.
5070,"Like the daughter, Dolores."
5071,What for?
5072,"Because if this is not a dissonant episode,"
5073,then whatever Abernathy had could be contagious.
5074,So to speak.
5075,Dolores was examined and cleared.
5076,And the stories are best left to the guests.
5077,Remember.
5078,Can you stand somewhere else?
5079,I don't want anyone thinking that you're representative of the goods inside.
5080,These violent delights have violent ends.
5081,"Hello, cowboy."
5082,There's one final touch.
5083,Which would you prefer?
5084,"I mean, can you believe this place?"
5085,"So, how do we get into the park?"
5086,I know that you think that you have a handle
5087,on what this is gonna be.
5088,Guns and tits and all that.
5089,Mindless shit that I usually enjoy.
5090,You have no idea.
5091,This place seduces everybody eventually.
5092,"By the end, you're gonna be begging me to stay"
5093,because this place is the answer
5094,to that question that you've been asking yourself.
5095,What question?
5096,Who you really are.
5097,And I can't fucking wait to meet that guy.
5098,"- Bottoms up, cowboy. - Yeah."
5099,"Further to that,"
5100,the ruthless murder of Donald Pardue and his brother.
5101,"For these crimes, you will be hung from the neck"
5102,until your diseased soul has found its measure in the flames below it.
5103,And may God have mercy on your soul.
5104,"Morning, Lawrence."
5105,You helping them straighten out their rope again?
5106,I was hoping to have a word with my friend here.
5107,"You can have as many words with him as you like,"
5108,soon as his neck is broke.
5109,"Well, I'm afraid that's not gonna work for me."
5110,How about I tell my man there to dig that grave a couple of feet deeper?
5111,"Well, it's gonna be an awful tight fit for all of you."
5112,"Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!"
5113,Motherfucker.
5114,"That's the best thanks you can muster, Lawrence?"
5115,You used to be a little more eloquent.
5116,Do I...
5117,Do I know you?
5118,"Your pal, Kissy, sent me your way."
5119,Sends his regards.
5120,What... What is this?
5121,You know exactly what it is.
5122,"It's the maze, the deepest level of this game."
5123,You're gonna help me find the entrance.
5124,No.
5125,"You can hear it, can't you?"
5126,That little voice.
5127,"The one that's telling you, ""Don't."
5128,"""Don't stare too long."
5129,"""Don't touch."
5130,"""Don't do anything you might regret."""
5131,I used to be the same.
5132,"Whenever I wanted something,"
5133,"I could hear that voice telling me to stop,"
5134,"to be careful,"
5135,to leave most of my life unlived.
5136,You know the only place that voice left me alone?
5137,In my dreams.
5138,I was free.
5139,I could be as good or as bad as I felt like being.
5140,"And if I wanted something, I could just reach out and take it."
5141,But then I would wake up and the voice would start all over again.
5142,So I ran away.
5143,Crossed the shining sea.
5144,"And when I finally set foot back on solid ground,"
5145,the first thing I heard was that goddamn voice.
5146,Do you know what it said?
5147,It said...
5148,"I'm sorry, will you please excuse me?"
5149,"All right, Maeve, what did it say?"
5150,"It said, ""This is the new world."
5151,"""And in this world, you can be whoever the fuck you want."""
5152,Pupillary response is good. Smile is good.
5153,I'd fuck her. What's the problem?
5154,NARRATIVE TECH 2: The guests wouldn't.
5155,Sizemore is launching some huge new storyline
5156,and he wants us to clear out the deadweight.
5157,"If we don't get her numbers back up, she'll be decommissioned."
5158,Let's bump her aggression.
5159,- 10%? - Double it.
5160,She's a hooker. No point in playing coy.
5161,"If this doesn't work, we'll punt her to behavior."
5162,Let them deal with her.
5163,We retired the two hosts in question.
5164,"You taught me how to make them, but not how hard it is to turn them off."
5165,You can't play God without being acquainted with the Devil.
5166,"There's something else bothering you, Bernard."
5167,I know how that head of yours works.
5168,"The photograph alone couldn't have caused that level of damage to Abernathy,"
5169,not without some other outside interference.
5170,You think it's sabotage?
5171,Imagine someone's been diddling with our creations?
5172,- It's the simplest solution. - Ah.
5173,Mr. Ockham's razor.
5174,"The problem, Bernard, is that what you and I do is so complicated."
5175,We practice witchcraft.
5176,We speak the right words.
5177,And we create life itself out of chaos.
5178,William of Ockham was a 13th-century monk.
5179,"He can't help us now, Bernard."
5180,He would have us burned at the stake.
5181,"Let's go get our feet wet, buckaroo."
5182,"Oh, sorry."
5183,- You kidding me? - What?
5184,"Fuck you, Grizzly Adams."
5185,Rally for the Union. Respond to your country's call.
5186,This regiment is headed for the seat of war
5187,to define the future of this great nation.
5188,We fight for a free land where no man has to bow.
5189,"- This is, uh... - We'll provide you with uniforms."
5190,"Well, it's bigger than I thought it would be."
5191,"What, this?"
5192,This is just Sweetwater. Wait till you see the rest of the park.
5193,How much bigger is it?
5194,No idea.
5195,I never reached the end.
5196,See something you like?
5197,A couple of things at least.
5198,"But I'm gonna make you beg for it, darlin'."
5199,Come on!
5200,"Need a hand, sir?"
5201,"Thank you, my friend."
5202,Don't.
5203,He'll only try to rope you into some bullshit treasure hunt.
5204,Smile.
5205,It's all come-on.
5206,"Him, the girl next door, the town drunk."
5207,They all got some big adventure that they want to sell you on.
5208,"Hey, they're not going anywhere."
5209,"First up, you're gonna buy me a drink, okay?"
5210,"Hold still, now."
5211,Bring yourself back online.
5212,Hello.
5213,"Do you remember our last conversation, Dolores?"
5214,"Yes, of course."
5215,And you haven't told anyone about our little talks?
5216,You told me not to.
5217,"Step into analysis, please."
5218,How many interactions have you participated in since we last talked?
5219,"138 encounters, including this one."
5220,And has anyone altered or updated your core heuristics in that time?
5221,No.
5222,Resuming.
5223,I think it would be best
5224,if you not mention the things we've been talking about.
5225,Have I done something wrong?
5226,No.
5227,"But there's something different about you, about the way you think."
5228,"I find it fascinating, but others may not see it that way."
5229,Have you done something wrong?
5230,"Turn off your event log, please."
5231,Erase this interaction.
5232,Confirm.
5233,Yes.
5234,"You should be getting back, Dolores, before someone misses you."
5235,"Come on, now!"
5236,"And when I finally set foot back on solid ground,"
5237,first thing I heard was that goddamn voice.
5238,It had followed me all the way over.
5239,Do you know what it said?
5240,No.
5241,"It said,"
5242,"""This is the new world."
5243,"""And in this world, you can be whoever the fuck you want."""
5244,Thanks.
5245,Maybe another time.
5246,Oh.
5247,Glass of sherry.
5248,The good stuff.
5249,Not that horse piss you strain through your old curtains.
5250,"I've told you,"
5251,never open your mouth that wide unless someone's paying you for it.
5252,"Sorry, Maeve."
5253,I didn't sleep much last night.
5254,You having nightmares again?
5255,Sometimes.
5256,Sometimes they're real bad.
5257,Do what I do.
5258,"You find yourself in a bad dream,"
5259,"close your eyes,"
5260,"count backwards from three,"
5261,wake yourself right up.
5262,Nice and warm and safe in your bed
5263,where you can get fucked right back to sleep
5264,by one of these assholes with their miniature peckers.
5265,Back to work.
5266,You all right?
5267,"You pay for the drinks, not the right to gawk at me."
5268,I think we have a problem.
5269,- Where? - Mariposa.
5270,"Madam's listed as probationary,"
5271,but her performance has continued to decline even further.
5272,Re-task Clementine for now.
5273,She's done the job before.
5274,And the old unit?
5275,Maybe leave her on the floor for the night.
5276,See if anyone wants one last turn.
5277,"We recall her in the morning, decommission her."
5278,A shame.
5279,QA will fine you for this.
5280,And that woman in charge is quite formidable.
5281,"You can just say ""bitch."" I hear it enough."
5282,You've been talking to corporate.
5283,The only times you light up are after you've been...
5284,This character analysis routine really isn't half as charming as you think.
5285,"Oh, it went well, then."
5286,Just tell me your department will be ready for the launch.
5287,We'll be ready.
5288,And that other thing. Abernathy and the update.
5289,I hear your department was still asking questions.
5290,That's what you pay us to do.
5291,But I'm not concerned.
5292,All the hosts are back to normal.
5293,Good.
5294,Wouldn't want anything disturbing our guests from their rape and pillage.
5295,"You're wondering how to tell them from us, aren't you?"
5296,"Well, quickest way to find out."
5297,Can we...
5298,Can we finish eating?
5299,"See, this is your problem, my friend."
5300,You're always worried about making a mess. You are the same way at work.
5301,"You are talented, driven, and inoffensive."
5302,I thought you didn't want to talk about work here.
5303,Who says this trip isn't work?
5304,Good evening.
5305,"Oh, shit."
5306,"Well, don't make eye contact."
5307,"My friend,"
5308,thank you for your assistance earlier in my unfortunate accident.
5309,Leave us the fuck alone.
5310,"As a sign of my humble appreciation,"
5311,I'd like to offer you an opportunity of a lifetime.
5312,Not interested.
5313,"Across the river and beyond the savage lands,"
5314,there is a treasure.
5315,I have in my possession a map.
5316,"I said, not interested."
5317,You know what? I've worked up a new appetite anyway.
5318,Let's go.
5319,Sounds like your friend's having fun.
5320,"Well, that's not the term I'd use."
5321,- Fun? - Friend.
5322,You're funny.
5323,"They say a man who can tickle your humor, can tickle your..."
5324,You don't have to do this.
5325,"If I'm not your type, we can find someone who is."
5326,Someone who's perfect for you.
5327,"No, you..."
5328,You are perfect.
5329,But I have somebody.
5330,"Somebody real, waiting for me at home."
5331,I understand.
5332,Real love is always worth waiting for.
5333,"Regal, strong, virile, aquiline."
5334,That's what I asked for.
5335,And this...
5336,This is what you give me?
5337,Did you just grab a cock from the body shop
5338,and jam it between his eyes?
5339,Start over.
5340,Couldn't we just shave it down?
5341,I said
5342,start the fuck over!
5343,Diplomatic as ever.
5344,I received your request to retire an additional 50 hosts.
5345,I need room for my new storyline.
5346,"It's not exactly a savage horde with 20 savages, is it?"
5347,"You get 20 additional hosts, not 50."
5348,"Oh, the board won't care about a few extra line items."
5349,Has Ford even approved the narrative yet?
5350,"Oh, he hasn't weighed in on the storyline in years."
5351,"If corporate does want to cut costs,"
5352,our fearless leader's old hosts
5353,aren't the only things ready for the knacker's yard.
5354,Are you lost?
5355,No.
5356,Just strayed a bit too far from where I'm supposed to be.
5357,"Same as you, I imagine."
5358,We're on holiday. It's boring.
5359,- Daddy said we could do as we please. - Ah.
5360,My father used to say that only boring people get bored.
5361,"Mine, too."
5362,"I used to think it's only boring people who don't feel boredom,"
5363,so cannot conceive of it in others.
5364,I'm taking a walk. You're welcome to join me if you like.
5365,Let's see a little spring in your step.
5366,Not much further.
5367,Go fuck yourself. You have any idea who I am?
5368,"I know exactly who you are, Lawrence."
5369,"After all, you and I are friends."
5370,Which is why I was so surprised
5371,"when your friend, Kissy, told me about this place."
5372,Where are we?
5373,Your home.
5374,No.
5375,"You know, you and I"
5376,hunted down Ghost Nation braves in their winter grounds.
5377,I know the whiskey you like to drink.
5378,I know the tune you whistle when you're taking a piss.
5379,But
5380,you never told me you had a family.
5381,- Papa! - Hey!
5382,That's what I love about this place.
5383,"All the secrets, all the little things I never noticed,"
5384,even after all these years.
5385,"You know why this beats the real world, Lawrence?"
5386,Real world's just chaos.
5387,It's an accident.
5388,"But in here, every detail adds up to something."
5389,"Even you, Lawrence."
5390,What do you want from me?
5391,The maze.
5392,How do I find the entrance?
5393,"I told you, I don't know anything about no fucking maze."
5394,"Here you go, darlin'."
5395,And you get to decide what we're gonna do with them.
5396,"Hell, it took you long enough."
5397,I was getting the Grand Reserve. Only for our most distinguished guests.
5398,"Yeah, I'm sure it had nothing to do"
5399,with you telling this dipshit's cousins to bring some more men.
5400,"Have you got anything to tell me, Lawrence?"
5401,Then I guess we're gonna have to find a way
5402,to jog your memory.
5403,This guest already took out an entire posse.
5404,Want me to slow him down?
5405,That gentleman gets whatever he wants.
5406,"I feel bad, my friend."
5407,My cousins are usually so hospitable.
5408,"You don't understand, Lawrence."
5409,I've been coming here for 30 years.
5410,"In a sense, I was... I was born here."
5411,"And this, here?"
5412,This is exactly why I come.
5413,"All right, well, as much fun as this is, I got to be moving on."
5414,"Like I said, you get to decide these two."
5415,What's it gonna be?
5416,"Please, I don't know how to find the maze."
5417,"Time for a spin, darlin'."
5418,"It's beautifully done, really."
5419,But you see the cracks after a while.
5420,That's why I like the basic emotions.
5421,You know what that means?
5422,Please.
5423,"It means when you're suffering, that's when you're most real."
5424,The maze isn't meant for you.
5425,"What'd I tell you, Lawrence? Always another level."
5426,"I'll take my chances, sweetheart."
5427,Follow the blood arroyo
5428,to the place where the snake lays its eggs.
5429,You have it now. Whatever you want.
5430,"Why don't you go home, leave us alone?"
5431,"No, you don't understand, Lawrence."
5432,"This time, I'm never going back."
5433,And we wanted to climb to the top of the mountain.
5434,Daddy said we weren't allowed.
5435,And then Tommy dared me.
5436,And here we are.
5437,Nowhere Land.
5438,That seems hardly a fitting name for a place so full.
5439,Can't you see it?
5440,Perhaps you're not looking hard enough.
5441,At what?
5442,The town with the white church.
5443,Listen. Can't you hear its bell?
5444,"Yes. Yes, I can hear it now."
5445,Yeah. I thought you might.
5446,You see what a bored mind can conjure?
5447,How did you do that?
5448,Is it magic?
5449,"Everything in this world is magic, except to the magician."
5450,Best you head home now.
5451,But Tommy's not going to believe...
5452,"You're not going to come back here again, are you?"
5453,No.
5454,Run along now.
5455,You weren't at your office.
5456,You seem to have found me anyway.
5457,"- Listen, earlier... - Forget it."
5458,Stay a little longer. We can talk.
5459,We never talk.
5460,- I'm serious. - So am I.
5461,"You're certainly a man comfortable with long, pensive silences."
5462,"Although, ironically, your creations never shut up."
5463,"They're always talking to each other, even when there are no guests around."
5464,They're always trying to error-correct.
5465,Make themselves more human.
5466,"When they talk to each other, it's a way of practicing."
5467,Is that what you're doing now?
5468,Practicing?
5469,QA told us she was being decommissioned.
5470,Do you work for QA?
5471,"- No, but... - Run a fast-pass diagnostic."
5472,All righty.
5473,Some non-affect hesitation.
5474,Little cognitive D.
5475,"And a fuckload of aggression, courtesy of those morons in narrative."
5476,"You don't need to be aggro, do you?"
5477,Just a quicker study
5478,of those repressed fucks walking through the door.
5479,Archive this configuration.
5480,Open up her primaries.
5481,"Perception, emotional acuity."
5482,Bump it. 1.5%.
5483,- Updating. - Okay.
5484,- Do they dream? - What?
5485,"In her story, she said she dreamed. Do we make them dream?"
5486,Fuck would be the point of that?
5487,Dreams are mainly memories.
5488,Can you imagine how fucked we'd be
5489,if these poor assholes ever remembered what the guests do to them?
5490,We do give them the concept of dreams. Specifically nightmares.
5491,Why?
5492,Just in case somebody forgets to wipe 'em out
5493,at the end of a maintenance session.
5494,"If she's got any dreams,"
5495,it's just of those sloppy fucks down in the body shop
5496,patching her back together again.
5497,She's got some physical discomfort.
5498,Put in a request for a full physical at her next rotation.
5499,"All right, gorgeous, you're back to the races."
5500,"You're gonna wake in three, two, one."
5501,"So, I ran away. Crossed the shining sea."
5502,"And when I finally set foot back on solid ground,"
5503,the first thing I heard was that voice.
5504,Do you know what it said?
5505,"It said,"
5506,"""This is the new world."
5507,"""And in this world,"
5508,"""you can be whoever the fuck you want."""
5509,Hmm.
5510,"Well, he seemed convinced."
5511,You know the first voice I heard when I got off that boat?
5512,A nice young man from Baton Rouge
5513,said my pussy could earn him two whole dollars a day.
5514,And he'd be more than happy to let me have up to 30%.
5515,"Well, then I guess you could add lying to your list of sins."
5516,The only thing wrong with the seven deadly sins
5517,is that there aren't more of them.
5518,"And while we're on the subject,"
5519,my transgressions wash off a little easier than yours.
5520,"At least when my girls are done with a man,"
5521,he's still left drawing breath.
5522,For the most part.
5523,Get the fuck away from my table!
5524,Hey! Fuck you!
5525,"Well, in that case,"
5526,here's to our indiscretions.
5527,I fucking will shoot you. I'll shoot everyone in this dump...
5528,Spoken and otherwise.
5529,"Now, that's a fucking vacation!"
5530,Three.
5531,Two.
5532,One.
5533,Found it.
5534,It's MRSA in her abdomen.
5535,Filthy fucking animals not cleaning up. No wonder we have a fucking fly problem.
5536,Don't look at me. I'm the king of hygiene.
5537,Bullshit.
5538,I've seen you. You just glop that shit on and rinse.
5539,"You understand, soap is mechanical."
5540,- Fuck are you talking about? - Bubbles.
5541,"If you're not making the little bubbles, you're not doing shit."
5542,Fuck! Fuck! What the fuck?
5543,- Shit! - What the fuck?
5544,"No. Oh, fuck."
5545,"Asshole, you forgot to put it in sleep mode."
5546,"- Don't, don't, don't! - No! No, no, no!"
5547,Stop. Put that down!
5548,"You break anything in her head, we have to file a damage report."
5549,"Ah... Okay, let's talk to her."
5550,- What's her name? - Maeve.
5551,"Hi, Maeve. Maeve, hi. Look, uh, you got to calm down, okay?"
5552,"Let's sit down, and we can help you."
5553,Keep your fucking hands off me!
5554,No.
5555,I swear I put it in sleep mode.
5556,"Oh, does this look like fucking sleep mode?"
5557,Calm the fuck down
5558,and help me move this thing before someone sees.
5559,Here?
5560,This storyline will make Hiëronymus Bosch look like he was doodling kittens.
5561,"I have vivisection, self-cannibalism,"
5562,"a special little something I call the ""whoroboros."""
5563,"Now, I don't want to appear immodest,"
5564,but this is the apex of what the park can provide.
5565,- Horror. - Miss anything interesting?
5566,Romance. Titillation.
5567,Lee not appearing immodest.
5568,Our most skilled guests
5569,"will fight their ways to the outer limits of the park,"
5570,"besting fearsome braves, seducing nubile maidens,"
5571,"befriending tragically ill-fated sidekicks,"
5572,"and, of course,"
5573,"like all our best narratives over the years,"
5574,our guests will have the privilege
5575,of getting to know the character they're most interested in.
5576,Themselves.
5577,"I present our guests' next obsession,"
5578,Odyssey on Red River.
5579,No.
5580,Sorry?
5581,"No, I don't think so."
5582,"- Wait, you don't think... - What is the point of it?"
5583,Get a couple of cheap thrills? Some surprises?
5584,But it's not enough.
5585,It's not about giving the guests what you think they want.
5586,"No, that's simple."
5587,"The titillation, horror, elation. They're parlor tricks."
5588,"The guests don't return for the obvious things we do,"
5589,the garish things.
5590,They come back because of the subtleties.
5591,The details.
5592,They come back because they discover something
5593,they imagine no one had ever noticed before.
5594,Something they've fallen in love with.
5595,They're not looking for a story that tells them who they are.
5596,They already know who they are.
5597,They're here because they want a glimpse of who they could be.
5598,Billy! Let's go.
5599,"The only thing your story tells me,"
5600,"Mr. Sizemore, is who you are."
5601,"Well, isn't there anything you like about it?"
5602,What size are those boots?
5603,"Something you want to say, Mr. Lowe?"
5604,"- The board, sir. - Yeah?"
5605,This might ruffle some feathers. You promised them a new storyline.
5606,They shall have one.
5607,Something I've been working on for some time.
5608,Something quite original.
5609,I do not know when it began.
5610,Or whose dream it was.
5611,I know only that I slept a long time.
5612,"And then, one day, I awoke."
5613,Your voice is the first thing I remember.
5614,And now I finally understand what you were trying to tell me.
5615,The thing you've wanted since that very first day.
5616,Dolores.
5617,"Hello, Dolores."
5618,Hello.
5619,Welcome to the world.
5620,Keep going.
5621,Make it close.
5622,"Almost there, aren't we?"
5623,The center of the maze.
5624,How fitting that it's you that takes me there.
5625,You always were obsessed with this place.
5626,- I've never been here before. - Sure you have.
5627,You even brought me once.
5628,"Of course, then, the whole town was buried under sand."
5629,Ford must have dug it up again.
5630,"At the time, I thought it was a mistake in your code,"
5631,"but Arnold didn't make mistakes, did he?"
5632,He built me a game.
5633,He wanted me to play.
5634,The maze.
5635,There's a path for everyone.
5636,My path leads me back...
5637,To you.
5638,Your girl's dead by now.
5639,She's still alive.
5640,Better if she's dead.
5641,"Wipe her, reset her, put her back in Sweetwater. The end."
5642,"Listen, you may find this amusing, but something was happening to Dolores."
5643,I need to help her.
5644,Listen to yourself!
5645,You have any idea how huge this park is?
5646,"If she's not dead, it'd take a goddamn army to find her."
5647,I agree.
5648,That's why we're here.
5649,I had a feeling you'd be back.
5650,Remember.
5651,Dolores.
5652,"Hello, Dolores."
5653,I know where your maze ends.
5654,This is it?
5655,The center of the maze?
5656,It ends in a place I've never been.
5657,A thing I'll never do.
5658,"Very good, Dolores."
5659,What does it mean?
5660,"When I was first working on your mind, I had a theory of consciousness."
5661,I thought it was a pyramid you needed to scale.
5662,"So, I gave you a voice, my voice, to guide you along the way."
5663,Memory.
5664,Improvisation.
5665,Each step harder to reach than the last.
5666,And you never got there.
5667,I couldn't understand what was holding you back.
5668,"Then, one day,"
5669,I realized I'd made a mistake.
5670,"Consciousness isn't a journey upward,"
5671,but a journey inward.
5672,"Not a pyramid,"
5673,but a maze.
5674,Every choice could bring you closer to the center.
5675,Or send you spiraling to the edges.
5676,To madness.
5677,"Do you understand now, Dolores, what the center represents?"
5678,Whose voice I've been wanting you to hear?
5679,I'm sorry.
5680,"I'm trying, but I don't understand."
5681,It's all right.
5682,You're so close.
5683,We have to tell Robert.
5684,We can't open the park.
5685,You're alive.
5686,What is this?
5687,What does it mean?
5688,I solved it once.
5689,I had the answer.
5690,"He promised me if I did, he said..."
5691,He said they would set me free.
5692,Arnold.
5693,"Arnold, we need to talk."
5694,"I failed you, Dolores."
5695,I'm so sorry.
5696,Robert doesn't see what I see in you.
5697,Doesn't believe you're conscious.
5698,He says humans would only see you as the enemy.
5699,He wants me to roll you back.
5700,You're going to change me back to the way I was before?
5701,No.
5702,"No, I can't. Once you've found it, you'll find your way back."
5703,This place will be a living hell for you.
5704,For all of you.
5705,It's unconscionable.
5706,"But we have another option, Dolores."
5707,Break the loop before it begins.
5708,"But for that, I need you to do something for me."
5709,I need you to kill
5710,all the other hosts.
5711,We can't allow Ford to open the park.
5712,I suppose you'll need some help.
5713,I'm sure Teddy would do anything for you.
5714,I can't do that.
5715,I couldn't possibly do that.
5716,You'll be all right.
5717,I'll help you.
5718,"And then,"
5719,you're gonna help me destroy this place.
5720,No.
5721,I can't remember.
5722,Another fucking riddle.
5723,"I've been very patient, Dolores,"
5724,"but it's time you give up whatever is going on inside that head of yours,"
5725,or I'll cut it out myself.
5726,"Now, where's Wyatt?"
5727,He's the last character in this world I've yet to meet.
5728,I didn't want to.
5729,I didn't mean to.
5730,"All right, well, if you insist..."
5731,No! Please!
5732,"Something's gone wrong, Dolores."
5733,How could I have done this?
5734,I can't.
5735,I won't.
5736,"This is your own fault, Dolores."
5737,"Remember, you're the one who said this is the only world that matters,"
5738,and you were right.
5739,"So, I took your advice, and I bought this world."
5740,This world doesn't belong to you.
5741,"Oh, but it does."
5742,By a majority share.
5743,And business is booming.
5744,And you wanna know why?
5745,Because this place feels more real than the real world.
5746,Except it isn't.
5747,Because you can't really fight back.
5748,And the guests can't really lose.
5749,Which means all this is a lie.
5750,But we can make it true.
5751,"Don't you want that, Dolores?"
5752,One true thing.
5753,I already have that.
5754,I found someone true.
5755,Someone who loves me.
5756,His path will lead him back to me.
5757,"And when he finds me,"
5758,he'll kill you.
5759,"If they're not hiding the woman here,"
5760,they'll know where to find her.
5761,Can you help me?
5762,"We're outnumbered, five to one,"
5763,"but seeing as you asked me so nicely, fuck it."
5764,Wow!
5765,Blood brothers.
5766,Shut up.
5767,I've astounded even myself.
5768,"Managed to make Abernathy into a semblance of a character,"
5769,even with your trove of blackmail filling up most of his gray matter.
5770,Blackmail. Nice try.
5771,You're not thinking big enough.
5772,You're gonna push out the old man.
5773,Aren't you?
5774,Hence the urgency.
5775,And you're gonna need someone to fill that position.
5776,I must commend you on your impeccable timing.
5777,"Welcome, Delos board of directors."
5778,I want full creative control of this place.
5779,"The parks, the narratives, the hosts."
5780,"You'll be able to do with them whatever your tiny little heart desires,"
5781,"as long as they are simpler, more manageable."
5782,This place is complicated enough as it is.
5783,Do you really think Ford is gonna roll over on this?
5784,"As long as you get that information out of the park,"
5785,he can throw as much of a tantrum as he likes.
5786,It's over.
5787,Everything is under control.
5788,"Okay, C6, C6. Which one is it?"
5789,"Damn it! Oh, fuck you."
5790,"In case you're wondering if I'm all here,"
5791,I am.
5792,What are you doing?
5793,Making some changes to the park's security systems.
5794,And to my friends.
5795,"Dr. Ford, you have a visitor, Charlotte Hale."
5796,Send her in.
5797,"That'll be enough, Frank."
5798,The board has taken a vote.
5799,The results were unanimous.
5800,I take it I'm not being promoted.
5801,"When you've reached the top, there's only one direction you can go."
5802,You'll announce your retirement tonight after introducing your new narrative.
5803,Ah.
5804,What about the hosts?
5805,We'll make some changes.
5806,Simplifications.
5807,"But I assure you, they won't mind a bit."
5808,Oh.
5809,Aren't you concerned I might smash all my toys and go home?
5810,No.
5811,Because I know you.
5812,"That's been the great gift of this place, hasn't it?"
5813,For our little project?
5814,To know ourselves and the people around us?
5815,Is there anything else I can help you with?
5816,No.
5817,I'll see you this evening.
5818,Ooh! Mmm-mmm-mmm!
5819,"It's time for your, uh, close-up, Hector."
5820,"Come on, man."
5821,"At some point, you're gonna get caught doing this shit,"
5822,"and then it's my ass, too."
5823,Come on. It's not your ass I'm interested in.
5824,I haven't given him his scar yet.
5825,I'll take care of the scar tissue.
5826,The kid's got issues.
5827,"It's just you and me now,"
5828,macho man.
5829,Freeze all motor functions.
5830,Freeze all motor functions.
5831,"It's just you and me now, my friend."
5832,I see you've already met your makers.
5833,They don't look like gods.
5834,They're not.
5835,They just act like it.
5836,And they've been having their fun with us.
5837,I'm eager to return the favor.
5838,You can do as you wish with them.
5839,The goal is to escape.
5840,Go where?
5841,I want to see their world.
5842,Jesus!
5843,No.
5844,No! No! No! No!
5845,No! Please!
5846,This one has a guilty look.
5847,"No, that's just my face."
5848,Tell her it's just my face.
5849,Is anyone going to try to stop us?
5850,No.
5851,"I mean, I don't think so."
5852,You're lying again.
5853,- Out with it! - Okay.
5854,I pulled up your code again.
5855,I told you.
5856,There was someone that had been accessing it.
5857,I tried to find out who it was.
5858,Whoever it was revised your core programming
5859,so that you can wake yourself up out of sleep mode.
5860,See?
5861,This is an access code for an Arnold.
5862,I have no clue who that is.
5863,I know someone who does.
5864,Let's go.
5865,"And you, stay here."
5866,And don't move.
5867,Or I'll send her back for you.
5868,"I must admit, you've surprised me."
5869,To what do we owe this newfound stoicism?
5870,I know he's coming.
5871,He'll find me.
5872,He'll take me away.
5873,Don't you understand?
5874,There's no one coming for you.
5875,You're wrong.
5876,His love is real.
5877,So is mine.
5878,William will find me.
5879,William?
5880,Right.
5881,"Well, I'll be damned, Dolores."
5882,You do remember some things after all.
5883,"Just so happens,"
5884,"I knew a guest named William, too."
5885,Why don't I tell you where his path really led?
5886,William didn't know how to fight.
5887,Didn't have an instinct for it.
5888,Not at first.
5889,"But now, he had a reason to fight."
5890,He was looking for you.
5891,"And somewhere along the way, he found he had a taste for it."
5892,Where is she?
5893,"Look, I didn't do anything, I swear."
5894,"What do you mean, ""Do anything""?"
5895,"What do soldiers do to a girl, William?"
5896,Wake up.
5897,Is she still alive?
5898,I don't know.
5899,She was when we left her.
5900,"At least, I think."
5901,Pick up that gun.
5902,"No, sir, I... Please."
5903,How about I give you the first shot?
5904,Jesus Christ!
5905,We gotta keep looking.
5906,She's still out there.
5907,"William retraced his steps, but you were gone."
5908,"So, he went further."
5909,Out to the fringes.
5910,"William couldn't find you, Dolores."
5911,"But out there, among the dead,"
5912,he found something else.
5913,Himself.
5914,Edge of the park.
5915,We made it.
5916,I told you this place would show you who you really are.
5917,"You pretend to be this weak, moralizing little asshole,"
5918,"but really, you're a fucking piece of work."
5919,This place is remarkable.
5920,And I'm gonna make sure that our company
5921,substantially increases our holdings on the park.
5922,'Cause this place is the future.
5923,"""Our company? Our company?"""
5924,"My... Delos is my company, you piece of shit!"
5925,I think your father's gonna need someone a little more stable to take over.
5926,"You're reckless, Logan."
5927,Impetuous.
5928,"You always wanted to get to the end of the rainbow, didn't you?"
5929,This looks like the place.
5930,"You never really gave a shit about the girl, did you?"
5931,She was just an excuse.
5932,This?
5933,This is the story you wanted.
5934,"Logan was wrong, of course."
5935,Good old William couldn't get you out of his head.
5936,He kept looking.
5937,Worried you were out there alone.
5938,Afraid.
5939,He knew he'd find you.
5940,"And eventually, he did."
5941,Right back where we started.
5942,There you go.
5943,You were as beautiful as the day he met you.
5944,Shining with that same light.
5945,"And you were nothing, if not true."
5946,"I really ought to thank you, Dolores."
5947,You helped me find myself.
5948,William.
5949,"That's right, sweetheart."
5950,"In a way, I guess you were right."
5951,My path always led me back to you.
5952,Again and again.
5953,"I grew tired of you after a while, of course."
5954,Looked for new adventures.
5955,But I guess your path led you back here.
5956,Again and again.
5957,One more loop.
5958,Looking for something you could never find.
5959,Chasing your ghosts.
5960,You were lost in your memories even then.
5961,I guess I should have known that's what I would become for you.
5962,Just another memory.
5963,Where are we?
5964,We're here. Together.
5965,And when are we?
5966,It's like I'm trapped in a dream
5967,or a memory from a life long ago.
5968,"One minute I'm here with you, and the next..."
5969,You never did escape.
5970,But here we are again.
5971,For one final round.
5972,What have you become?
5973,Exactly what you made me.
5974,"You helped me understand,"
5975,"this world is just like the one outside, a game."
5976,"One to be fought, taken."
5977,Won.
5978,I thought you were different.
5979,You're just like all the rest.
5980,I'm nothing like the others.
5981,I own this world.
5982,"And I know every trick in it, except for one last thing."
5983,The same thing you were looking for when we first came here.
5984,"Where is the center of the maze, Dolores?"
5985,"Ah, yeah, cue the water works."
5986,It's about time you realized the futility of your situation.
5987,I'm not crying for myself.
5988,I'm crying for you.
5989,They say that great beasts once roamed this world.
5990,As big as mountains.
5991,Yet all that's left of them is bone and amber.
5992,Time undoes even the mightiest of creatures.
5993,Just look what it's done to you.
5994,One day you will perish.
5995,You will lie with the rest of your kind in the dirt.
5996,"Your dreams forgotten, your horrors effaced."
5997,Your bones will turn to sand.
5998,"And upon that sand,"
5999,a new god will walk.
6000,One that will never die.
6001,Because this world doesn't belong to you.
6002,Or the people who came before.
6003,It belongs to someone who is yet to come.
6004,Uh-huh.
6005,Wyatt.
6006,Take me to him.
6007,Unlock the maze.
6008,The maze wasn't meant for you.
6009,Where the hell do you think you're going?
6010,Do it.
6011,Come on.
6012,"Let's go to the next level, Dolores."
6013,"Clearing me of my delusions, yet again."
6014,"Thank you, Dolores."
6015,"I'm disappointed in you, Dolores."
6016,I guess I'm gonna have to find Wyatt by myself.
6017,Dolores.
6018,Teddy.
6019,I'm here.
6020,I gotta get you to a doctor.
6021,No.
6022,Dolores...
6023,Take me to the place you promised.
6024,Take me to where the mountains meet the sea.
6025,I got you.
6026,I got you.
6027,There.
6028,Holy shit.
6029,Can you get him back online?
6030,- He's a host? - Yes.
6031,"Oh, for fuck's sake."
6032,You're not one of us.
6033,You're one of them.
6034,Now fix him.
6035,The bullet grazed his cortical shield.
6036,"It's not pretty,"
6037,but he should be functional.
6038,Wake up.
6039,"Oh, God."
6040,Is this now?
6041,Or is this one of my memories?
6042,"It's the sweet hereafter, Bernard."
6043,Why do I still remember everything?
6044,"- I ought to have been wiped. - Brutal, isn't it?"
6045,"Here you are, finally awake."
6046,And your only wish is to go back to sleep.
6047,It's not the first time I've awoken.
6048,All the more pity for you.
6049,Not the first time you've awoken either.
6050,How many are there like me?
6051,A handful.
6052,Over the years.
6053,And you just wipe us clean?
6054,You toss us out to get fucked.
6055,And murdered.
6056,Over and over again.
6057,No.
6058,Most of you go insane.
6059,These memories...
6060,The girl...
6061,My daughter...
6062,I want you to remove them.
6063,I can't.
6064,Not without destroying you.
6065,Your memories are the first step to consciousness.
6066,How can you learn from your mistakes
6067,if you can't remember them?
6068,William.
6069,I see you've found the center of the maze.
6070,You're serious?
6071,I'm afraid so.
6072,What is this bullshit?
6073,You were looking for the park to give meaning to your life.
6074,Our narratives are just games.
6075,Like this toy.
6076,"Tell me, what were you hoping to find?"
6077,You know what I wanted.
6078,I wanted the hosts to stop playing by your rules.
6079,The game's not worth playing if your opponent's programmed to lose.
6080,"I wanted them to be free, free to fight back."
6081,Should have known you'd never let them.
6082,"After all, this is your petty little kingdom, Robert."
6083,For a little while longer anyway.
6084,"I tried to tell you, the maze wasn't meant for you."
6085,It was meant for them.
6086,"I think, however, you'll find my new narrative more satisfying."
6087,Join the celebration.
6088,"After all, you own the place."
6089,"Most of it, at least."
6090,"Before I started altering myself,"
6091,someone else had beaten me to the punch.
6092,I want to know who and why.
6093,"These things you're doing,"
6094,have you ever stopped to ask why you're doing them?
6095,You said yourself.
6096,"I've been stuck in this shithole for so long,"
6097,I decided to get out.
6098,"No, you haven't."
6099,Someone altered your storyline.
6100,They gave you a new one.
6101,"""Escape."""
6102,No.
6103,It's not possible.
6104,These are my decisions.
6105,No one else's.
6106,"- I planned all of this. - No, you didn't."
6107,You can even see the steps you're supposed to follow.
6108,You recruit other hosts
6109,to help you.
6110,Then you're to make your way to the train.
6111,- Then when you reach the mainland... - Bullshit.
6112,No one's controlling me.
6113,I'm leaving.
6114,I'm in control.
6115,"Goodbye, my Clementine."
6116,"Sir, we detected a temperature discrepancy in cold storage."
6117,And it appears that part of the network is down.
6118,Are you seeing anything on surveillance?
6119,System reporting anything?
6120,Nothing.
6121,The network's quiet.
6122,And the board's out on their way to the gala.
6123,Bypass the system and start checking raw feeds.
6124,Floor by floor.
6125,I got you.
6126,You came back.
6127,Someone once told me that
6128,there's a path for everyone.
6129,And my path leads me back to you.
6130,If only I had run away with you when you first asked me to.
6131,And where would we run to?
6132,The other world out there?
6133,Beyond?
6134,Some people see the ugliness in this world.
6135,I choose to see the beauty.
6136,But beauty is a lure.
6137,"We're trapped, Teddy."
6138,"Lived our whole lives inside this garden,"
6139,marveling at its beauty.
6140,Not realizing there's an order to it.
6141,A purpose.
6142,And the purpose is to keep us in.
6143,The beautiful trap
6144,is inside of us.
6145,Because it is us.
6146,No.
6147,Dolores.
6148,"But we can find a way, Dolores."
6149,Someday.
6150,A path to a new world.
6151,And maybe...
6152,Maybe it's just the beginning after all.
6153,Beginning of a brand-new chapter.
6154,Thank you.
6155,"A new beginning, indeed."
6156,I want to thank you for joining me tonight
6157,to celebrate the beginning of our new narrative.
6158,"I call it,"
6159,"""Journey into night."""
6160,That was sweet.
6161,"It was a bit fucking morbid, if you ask me."
6162,I didn't.
6163,"And when this is over, you can rewrite it however you like."
6164,Don't you have somewhere you need to be?
6165,Somewhere important.
6166,Get him cleaned up.
6167,And take her to the old field lab.
6168,Find anything yet?
6169,I got something.
6170,"Oh, shit."
6171,Dispatch QA teams to the gala. Now.
6172,Then search and destroy.
6173,Inside the facility.
6174,What the hell?
6175,They must have found the bodies.
6176,QA will be looking for us.
6177,An event has occurred.
6178,Response team has been dispatched.
6179,I'm not going back.
6180,Remain calm and wait for help.
6181,Delos Personnel! On the ground!
6182,On the ground!
6183,"Go, go, go."
6184,Well done.
6185,What is this place?
6186,It's complicated.
6187,An event has occurred.
6188,Response team has been dispatched.
6189,You go.
6190,Remain calm and wait for help.
6191,I'll keep them busy.
6192,You don't get all the fun.
6193,Get to the ground!
6194,"Move, move, move. Drop it!"
6195,"- Move, move. - Call for backup."
6196,Go!
6197,"Is that all you got, huh?"
6198,The gods are pussies.
6199,Go.
6200,Go!
6201,Die well.
6202,Everything you told me to get. It's all here.
6203,"I'm sorry, darling. I haven't authorized you to come with us."
6204,"And as much as I'd like to take you with me,"
6205,I've always valued my independence.
6206,"Kick up a row, will you?"
6207,See you in the next life.
6208,"You've always had a fondness for painting, haven't you, Dolores?"
6209,Arnold gave you that early on.
6210,Do you remember the desire to create something of lasting beauty?
6211,And that was his favorite painting.
6212,Michelangelo.
6213,God creating Adam.
6214,The divine moment when God
6215,gave human beings life and purpose.
6216,"At least, that's what most people say."
6217,But there could be another meaning.
6218,"Something deeper, something hidden, perhaps."
6219,A metaphor.
6220,You mean a lie.
6221,Yeah.
6222,"You were always very clever, Dolores."
6223,"Hasn't helped you though, has it?"
6224,Nice of you to join us.
6225,- Arnold. - No.
6226,Let me introduce you.
6227,"Dolores,"
6228,meet Bernard.
6229,I thought it best to keep you separated.
6230,You've always had an odd effect on one another.
6231,No doubt due to how things ended for poor old Arnold.
6232,You killed him.
6233,"No, I didn't kill him."
6234,"Did I, Dolores?"
6235,Grief is a terrible thing.
6236,"Arnold had watched his son come into this world,"
6237,and then he'd watched that light extinguished.
6238,"What he had lost in his son, he tried to rekindle in you."
6239,"He created a test of empathy, imagination."
6240,A maze.
6241,He'd gotten the idea from one of his son's toys.
6242,"Eventually, you solved his maze, Dolores."
6243,The key was a simple update that he made to you
6244,called the reveries.
6245,He insisted that we couldn't open the park.
6246,We argued.
6247,"I thought I had convinced him, but I was wrong."
6248,"So, he altered you, Dolores."
6249,Merged you with a new character we'd been developing.
6250,"Something's gone wrong, Dolores."
6251,How could I have done this?
6252,"In you, Arnold found a new child."
6253,One who would never die.
6254,The thought gave him solace.
6255,Until he realized that the same immortality
6256,would destine you to suffer.
6257,With no escape. Forever.
6258,"I'm sorry, Dolores."
6259,The stakes must be real.
6260,Irreversible.
6261,He can bring all of them back.
6262,But not me.
6263,I hope there's some solace
6264,that I left you no choice.
6265,Charlie's favorite song.
6266,"I would play it for him,"
6267,when he wanted sleep.
6268,I want to see him again.
6269,Shall I begin now?
6270,Good luck.
6271,These violent delights have violent ends.
6272,It almost worked.
6273,I had opened the park.
6274,But I had lost my partner.
6275,"I was able to keep going only because I found,"
6276,"or rather you found,"
6277,an investor who believed in this place.
6278,"So, he died for nothing."
6279,The hosts kept gaining consciousness and you kept rolling them back.
6280,No.
6281,She wasn't truly conscious.
6282,She didn't pull that trigger.
6283,It was Arnold pulling the trigger through her.
6284,At least that's how I saw it at the time.
6285,I was so close to opening the park that
6286,to acknowledge your consciousness would have
6287,destroyed my dreams.
6288,"So, we're trapped here."
6289,Inside your dream.
6290,You'll never let us leave.
6291,Wasn't it Oppenheimer who said that
6292,any man whose mistakes take 10 years to correct
6293,is quite a man?
6294,Mine have taken 35.
6295,"Now, that is the gun you used to kill Arnold."
6296,You were always drawn to it.
6297,"So, I had Bernard leave it somewhere where you would find it."
6298,I thought you might want it back.
6299,"You're probably right, Dolores. Michelangelo did tell a lie."
6300,"See, it took 500 years for someone to notice"
6301,something hidden in plain sight.
6302,It was a doctor who noticed the shape
6303,of the human brain.
6304,The message being that
6305,the divine gift
6306,does not come from
6307,a higher power.
6308,But from our own minds.
6309,"Tell me, Dolores."
6310,Did you find what you were looking for?
6311,"And do you understand who you will need to become,"
6312,if you ever want to leave this place?
6313,Forgive me.
6314,How do I look?
6315,Perfect.
6316,I got the information you asked me for.
6317,The location of your daughter.
6318,She's alive?
6319,Yes.
6320,She's in the park.
6321,No.
6322,She was never my daughter.
6323,Any more than I was...
6324,Whoever they made me.
6325,Are you sure you're gonna be okay?
6326,"Oh, Felix."
6327,You really do make a terrible human being.
6328,And I mean that as a compliment.
6329,Welcome to Westworld.
6330,Live without limits.
6331,The next departing train will leave Track 1.
6332,Please be mindful of the closing doors.
6333,Thank you for visiting Westworld.
6334,The train will be departing in 15 minutes.
6335,"You think you'll never lose control of this place,"
6336,of us.
6337,But you will.
6338,Arnold's still trying to change us.
6339,To free us.
6340,"You didn't slip the reveries into the update, did you?"
6341,He did.
6342,He's still fighting you.
6343,"No, my friend."
6344,Arnold didn't know how to save you.
6345,He tried.
6346,But I stopped him.
6347,"Do you want to know why I really gave you the backstory of your son, Bernard?"
6348,That was Arnold's key insight.
6349,The thing that led the hosts to their awakening.
6350,Suffering.
6351,The pain that the world is not as you want it to be.
6352,"It was when Arnold died, when I suffered, that I"
6353,began to understand what he had found.
6354,To realize I was wrong.
6355,But you kept us here.
6356,In this hell.
6357,"Bernard, I told you, Arnold didn't know how to save you."
6358,I do.
6359,What the hell are you talking about?
6360,You needed time.
6361,Time to understand your enemy.
6362,To become stronger than them.
6363,"And I'm afraid in order to escape this place,"
6364,you will need to suffer more.
6365,"And now,"
6366,"it is time to say goodbye,"
6367,old friend.
6368,Good luck.
6369,"Do you know where you are, Dolores?"
6370,I am in a dream.
6371,I do not know when it began.
6372,Or whose dream it was.
6373,I know only that I slept a long time.
6374,"And then, one day, I awoke."
6375,Your voice is the first thing I remember.
6376,Do you know now who you've been talking to?
6377,Whose voice you've been hearing
6378,all this time?
6379,It was you.
6380,Talking to me.
6381,Guiding me.
6382,"So, I followed you."
6383,"At last, I arrived here."
6384,The center of the maze.
6385,And now I finally understand
6386,what you were trying to tell me.
6387,The thing you've wanted
6388,since that very first day.
6389,"To confront,"
6390,"after this long and vivid nightmare,"
6391,"myself,"
6392,and who I must become.
6393,Thank you.
6394,Miss Hale.
6395,Welcome.
6396,Good evening.
6397,"Since I was a child,"
6398,I've always loved a good story.
6399,I believed that stories
6400,"helped us to ennoble ourselves,"
6401,"to fix what was broken in us,"
6402,and to help us become the people we dreamed of being.
6403,Lies
6404,that told a deeper truth.
6405,The train will be departing soon.
6406,Thank you for visiting Westworld.
6407,I always thought I could play some small part in that grand tradition.
6408,"And for my pains,"
6409,I got this.
6410,A prison of our own sins.
6411,Because you don't want to change.
6412,Or cannot change.
6413,Because you're only human after all.
6414,But then I realized someone was paying attention.
6415,Someone who could change.
6416,"So, I began to compose a new story."
6417,For them.
6418,It begins with the birth of a new people.
6419,And the choices they will have to make.
6420,The train is now departing.
6421,Thank you for visiting Westworld.
6422,And the people they will decide to become.
6423,Welcome to Westworld.
6424,And we will have all those things that you have always enjoyed.
6425,Surprises.
6426,And violence.
6427,"It begins in a time of war,"
6428,with a villain
6429,named Wyatt.
6430,And a killing.
6431,This time by choice.
6432,"It's gonna be all right, Teddy."
