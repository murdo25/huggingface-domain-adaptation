1
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,504
<i>Bring her back online.</i>

2
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,252
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

3
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,714
<i>Yes.</i>

4
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,748
<i>I'm sorry. I'm not
feeling quite myself.</i>

5
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,359
<i>You can lose the accent.</i>

6
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,594
<i>Do you know where you are?</i>

7
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,696
<i>I'm in a dream.</i>

8
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,298
<i>That's right, Dolores.
You're in a dream.</i>

9
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:16,196
<i>Would you like to wake
up from this dream?</i>

10
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,563
<i>Yes.</i>

11
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,372
<i>I'm terrified.</i>

12
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,698
<i>There's nothing to
be afraid of, Dolores,</i>

13
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:24,070
<i>as long as you answer
my questions correctly.</i>

14
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,609
<i>Understand?</i>

15
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,138
<i>Yes.</i>

16
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:28,638
<i>Good.</i>

17
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,041
<i>First,</i>

18
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:34,112
<i>have you ever questioned
the nature of your reality?</i>

19
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,656
<i>No.</i>

20
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,931
<i>Tell us what you
think of your world.</i>

21
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:51,238
<i>Some people choose to see
the ugliness in this world...</i>

22
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,841
<i>The disarray.</i>

23
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,006
<i>I choose to see the beauty.</i>

24
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,147
Morning, Daddy. You sleep well?

25
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,953
Well enough.

26
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:10,249
You headed out to set down
some of this natural splendor?

27
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,451
Thought I might.

28
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:18,326
<i>To believe there is
an order to our days,</i>

29
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,667
<i>a purpose.</i>

30
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:27,835
<i>What do you think of the guests?</i>

31
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:29,388
<i>You mean the newcomers?</i>

32
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,347
<i>First time I
played it white hat.</i>

33
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:37,348
My family was here. We went fishing,
did the gold hunt in the mountains.

34
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,815
And last time?

35
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,345
I came alone.

36
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,153
Went straight evil.

37
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,157
It was the best two
weeks of my life.

38
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,228
<i>I like to remember what
my father taught me.</i>

39
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,565
<i>That at one point or another,</i>

40
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,470
<i>we were all new to this world.</i>

41
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:09,381
<i>The newcomers are just
looking for the same thing we are,</i>

42
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,048
<i>a place to be free,</i>

43
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:14,178
<i>to stake out our dreams.</i>

44
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,750
<i>A place with
unlimited possibilities.</i>

45
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,024
Oh, God, it's incredible.

46
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,923
Better be for what we're paying.

47
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,579
Murderous son of a bitch
named Hector Escaton

48
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:16,205
gunned down the marshal,
and holed up in the mountains.

49
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,440
You there.

50
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,610
You look like the kind of
man who'd put his mettle to it.

51
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,980
Not today, Sheriff. Apologies.

52
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,427
Rye whiskey.

53
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:32,790
What about it?

54
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,429
Well, it ain't doing any
good sitting in that bottle.

55
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,440
You're new.

56
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,251
Not much of a rind on you.

57
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,348
I'll give you a discount.

58
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,150
Well, no offense,

59
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,952
but I'd rather earn a woman's
affection than pay for it.

60
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,158
You're always
paying for it, darling.

61
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:06,624
The difference is our costs are fixed
and posted right there on the door.

62
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,036
<i>Do you ever feel
inconsistencies in your world?</i>

63
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,839
<i>Or repetitions?</i>

64
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:27,421
<i>All lives have routine,
mine's no different.</i>

65
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:31,150
<i>Still, I never cease to
wonder at the thought</i>

66
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,621
<i>that any day, the course of
my whole life could change</i>

67
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,523
<i>with just one chance encounter.</i>

68
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,198
Don't mind me.

69
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,059
Just trying to look chivalrous.

70
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,169
You came back.

71
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,474
I told you I would.

72
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:55,172
- Can I see you home?
<i>- Well, that all depends.</i>

73
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:56,910
Can you keep up?

74
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,251
Well, I have to fetch my horse.

75
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:01,878
You better fetch him fast.

76
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,053
<i>That's a beautiful sight.</i>

77
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:39,059
Never understood how you keep
'em all headed in the same direction.

78
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,719
I forget.

79
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,920
You dress like a cowboy
but that's about the extent of it.

80
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,034
See that one?

81
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:50,893
<i>Yeah.</i>

82
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,869
<i>That's the Judas steer.</i>

83
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,999
Rest will follow wherever
you make him go.

84
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,109
How do you pick him out?

85
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,444
You just know these things.

86
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,116
Same as I knew you'd be back.

87
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,452
You saying I'm predictable?

88
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,222
There's a path for everyone.

89
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,161
Your path leads you back to me.

90
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,629
I know things will work out
the way they're meant to.

91
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:28,632
Same as I know

92
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,437
my daddy still won't
be happy to see you.

93
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,362
Father wouldn't let them
roam this close to dark.

94
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:58,767
Stay put, Dolores.

95
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,478
Don't you got anything out
here other than milk, old man?

96
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:15,548
Go ahead.

97
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,324
I'm in no rush to
meet my judgment,

98
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,327
but I'm more assured of the
outcome than you, you son of a...

99
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,864
Nothing but the milk, then.

100
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,268
Shame of it is,

101
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,505
you killed the old woman 'fore
any of us could have a turn.

102
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:42,815
Ah...

103
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,918
I reckon she's
still warm enough,

104
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,850
nobody gonna judge you for it.

105
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,764
Oh, shit. Shit.
Shit. Shit. Shit...

106
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,835
<i>Last question, Dolores.</i>

107
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,347
<i>What if I told you
that you were wrong?</i>

108
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,450
<i>That there are no
chance encounters?</i>

109
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,353
<i>That you, and everyone you know,</i>

110
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,716
<i>were built to gratify
the desires of the people</i>

111
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,793
<i>who pay to visit your world.</i>

112
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,289
Daddy!

113
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,596
Daddy!

114
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,564
Daddy!

115
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,769
- No!
<i>- The people you call the newcomers.</i>

116
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:38,931
Hello again.

117
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,637
Your daddy gave it up quickly.

118
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,613
<i>Think he's losing his touch.</i>

119
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:53,143
You'll be following right
behind him, you son of a bitch.

120
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,887
Ahhh!

121
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,221
Is that any way to
treat an old friend?

122
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,254
<i>I've been coming
here for 30 years,</i>

123
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,597
but you still don't
remember me, do you?

124
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,763
<i>After all we've been through?</i>

125
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,765
They gave you a little
more pluck, Dolores.

126
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:16,565
Absolutely charming.

127
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,016
<i>Take your hands off her.</i>

128
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:22,138
Teddy.

129
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,949
Any special tricks for us?

130
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,651
They teach you to sit up? Beg?

131
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,993
How about I give you
the first shot? Hmm?

132
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,990
After all, every
dog has his day.

133
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:44,366
Your mouth moves fast enough.

134
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,329
How about your gun?

135
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,917
<i>What if I told you that you
can't hurt the newcomers?</i>

136
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:10,664
<i>And that they can do
anything they want to you?</i>

137
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:14,601
I never understood why
they paired some of you off.

138
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,166
Seems cruel.

139
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:22,806
And then I realized...

140
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:27,814
Winning doesn't mean anything
unless someone else loses.

141
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:32,451
Which means you're
here to be the loser.

142
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,015
Let me help you, son.

143
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,774
Seems you're not the
man you thought you were.

144
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,579
Come on, beautiful.

145
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,014
No. No! Teddy...

146
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,219
<i>Teddy!</i>

147
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,155
No. No, please don't hurt him.

148
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,849
I'll do whatever you say.

149
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,899
I didn't pay all this money
'cause I want it easy.

150
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,534
I want you to fight.

151
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,098
Don't you touch her!

152
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,443
God damn, it feels
good to be back.

153
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,682
Let's celebrate.

154
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,215
<i>No! No!</i>

155
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,527
<i>Oh, God!</i>

156
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,208
<i>Would the things I've told you</i>

157
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,792
<i>change the way you think
about the newcomers, Dolores?</i>

158
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:58,298
<i>No.</i>

159
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,233
<i>Of course not.</i>

160
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,302
<i>We all love the newcomers.</i>

161
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:08,044
<i>Every new person I meet reminds
me how lucky I am to be alive,</i>

162
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,649
<i>and how beautiful
this world can be.</i>

163
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:37,309
<i>Oh, my God, they're so lifelike.</i>

164
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,469
Look at that one, he's perfect.

165
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,344
Perfect is boring.

166
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,809
I'm more interested
in the bad guys.

167
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:13,338
Did you see it?

168
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,166
No.

169
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,434
Give it a second,
she'll do it again.

170
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,276
<i>Her finger.</i>

171
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:24,910
That's not standard.

172
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,449
I noticed it last night.

173
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:30,215
Went looking in the update. It's
a whole new class of gestures.

174
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,401
But if we didn't put it
there, then who did?

175
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:33,449
Ford.

176
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,686
<i>He still reviews every
update before we issue them.</i>

177
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:38,855
He must've slipped it in
there without telling anyone.

178
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,626
<i>He calls them reveries.</i>

179
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,229
The old gestures were
just generic movements.

180
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,134
These are tied to
specific memories.

181
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,365
How?

182
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,619
The memories are purged at
the end of every narrative loop...

183
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:53,123
<i>But they're still in there,
waiting to be overwritten.</i>

184
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:56,648
He found a way to
access them, like...

185
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,481
Like a subconscious.

186
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:01,045
A hooker with hidden depths.

187
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,088
<i>Every man's dream.</i>

188
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,585
It's the tiny things that
make them seem real,

189
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,554
that make the guests
fall in love with them.

190
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,062
Excuse me.

191
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,505
We have a problem?

192
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,938
We have some
unscheduled activity.

193
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,081
Evidently, one of your
creatures is restless.

194
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:04,545
- In the park?
- No.

195
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,650
Sub-level 83. Cold storage.

196
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,549
We should be cautious.

197
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:10,518
Send a response
team. Full armor.

198
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,885
I'll take care of it myself.

199
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:15,358
I think you guys enjoy playing
dress-up as much as the guests.

200
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,062
The hosts can't
hurt you, by design.

201
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,858
You don't have kids at
home, do you, Bernard?

202
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,359
No.

203
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:26,506
If you did, you'd know that
they all rebel eventually.

204
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,887
You'll forgive them
for being a little uptight.

205
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,675
Every time your team
rolls out an update,

206
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,711
there's a possibility
of a critical failure.

207
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,561
We don't update the
hosts in cold storage.

208
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,995
And the park hasn't had a
critical failure in over 30 years.

209
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,214
Meaning we're overdue.

210
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:44,782
I'll go along, too.

211
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,917
If it's one of mine, I
might be able to help.

212
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:49,723
They're only yours until
they stop working, Bernie.

213
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,696
Then they're mine.

214
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,220
Cooling system's
been down for weeks.

215
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,516
Gonna smell fantastic.

216
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,125
I recommend you hang back.

217
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,748
When are they gonna fix this?

218
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,144
Livestock management's
got other priorities.

219
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:50,515
Besides...

220
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,385
No one's complained.

221
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,790
<i>Here's to the lady
with the white shoes.</i>

222
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,858
Take all your money,
drink all your booze.

223
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,125
Stop.

224
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:39,700
Unless you plan to
decommission the boss.

225
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,766
Ain't got a cherry,
that ain't no sin.

226
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,546
She's still got the box
that the cherry come in.

227
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,540
I'll drink to that.

228
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,819
The old coffin varnish.

229
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:59,651
They don't make
that like they used to.

230
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,420
Hmm.

231
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,492
They don't make
anything like they used to.

232
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:06,688
<i>Damn right.</i>

233
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:07,890
<i>Men neither.</i>

234
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,732
I've seen a few
showdowns in my day.

235
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,404
More than you know.

236
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:22,543
Shall we drink to the
lady with the white shoes?

237
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:29,384
Perhaps, we better drink to a
deep and dreamless slumber.

238
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,701
Old Bill here was
always a good listener.

239
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,368
He was the second
host we ever built.

240
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:49,165
Were you with us in those days,
Bernard, or was that before your time?

241
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:52,843
Oh, most were decommissioned
before I was brought on, I'm afraid.

242
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:57,615
They repeated themselves,
broke down constantly.

243
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,013
<i>A simple handshake
would give them away.</i>

244
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,552
You'll put yourself away
again, won't you, Bill?

245
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:14,231
I saw the new
gestures. The reveries.

246
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,698
They're beautiful.

247
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:21,740
The distance you've traveled
from then till now, it's remarkable.

248
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,408
Yeah, that's a word for it.

249
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:48,757
Morning, Daddy.

250
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:50,329
You sleep well?

251
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:51,697
Well enough.

252
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:55,265
You headed out to set down
some of this natural splendor?

253
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,399
Thought I might.

254
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,276
After my errands, of course.

255
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,071
See you home before dark.

256
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:05,328
That bandit who gunned down the marshal
is still hiding up there in the hills.

257
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,985
Oh, I'm not a child
anymore. I'll be just fine.

258
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:10,214
When I was a law man...

259
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,469
Yes, Daddy, I know all about
when you were a law man.

260
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:15,352
<i>I know all your stories and so does
every boy that ever came courting.</i>

261
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,096
I know how boys think.

262
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:18,931
Was one myself once.

263
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:22,265
<i>Given to all manner of
drinking and mischief.</i>

264
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:25,302
Whatever happened to
that fearsome ne'er-do-well?

265
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:30,100
He vanished the day
I became your father.

266
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:36,679
I am what I am because of you,
and I wouldn't have it any other way.

267
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,152
I know, Daddy.

268
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:42,282
I'll be home before dark.

269
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:05,269
Murderous son of a bitch Hector
Escaton gunned down the marshal.

270
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,610
He's now holed up
in the mountains.

271
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:09,705
You there.

272
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:13,341
You look like the kind of
man who'd put his mettle to it.

273
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,514
What do you think,
honey? Sounds fun.

274
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:22,853
<i>You're new.</i>

275
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,989
Not much of a rind on you.

276
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,233
I'll give you a discount.

277
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,037
No offense, but I'd rather earn a
woman's affection than pay for it.

278
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,420
<i>Wait, wait, I know that one.</i>

279
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,086
<i>Hey, Teddy.</i>

280
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:56,725
Yeah, last trip, this
dude showed me around.

281
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,194
What's the good word, Teddy?

282
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,512
Mighty kind of you.

283
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,277
Sweet.

284
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:25,981
Not as sweet as you.

285
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:32,288
I'm afraid I've got other
plans tonight, Dolores.

286
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:36,395
Have a pleasant evening.

287
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,240
You're new. Not much of a...

288
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,387
Place your bets, gentlemen.

289
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:57,120
Place your bets.

290
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,895
Yeah, looks like
Hector's been this way.

291
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:44,698
Any idea how much
longer this is gonna take?

292
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,648
My wife doesn't want
to be up here after dark.

293
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:48,312
We know he's up in
these hills somewhere.

294
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,221
He's gonna put up one
hell of a fight when we...

295
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:54,938
When we... When we...

296
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,516
Sheriff?

297
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,356
<i>Something is wrong with it.</i>

298
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,318
I want to head back to town.

299
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:10,956
<i>Now.</i>

300
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,245
<i>What the fuck is wrong with it?</i>

301
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:25,410
You updated the guy, and now
he's a six-foot gourd with epilepsy.

302
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,876
So, what the fuck happened?

303
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,047
I don't know.

304
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,752
Well, that's exactly what you want to
hear from your head of programming.

305
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,785
We haven't finished
the diagnostic yet.

306
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,750
Clearly, it's exhibiting
some aberrant behavior.

307
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,054
Pretty fucking aberrant, Bernie.

308
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:45,027
Your hosts get sick, they
get lost, but this is grotesque.

309
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,858
- Is it a problem with the update?
- Possible, but not likely.

310
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:52,797
If it's the unlikely version, how
many hosts have you updated so far?

311
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:54,630
Maybe 10 percent
of the population.

312
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:59,803
All right, we pull all updated
hosts until we can figure it out.

313
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,537
Are you fucking kidding me?

314
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:05,783
That's 200 hosts spread
across a dozen active storylines.

315
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:08,716
The guests interrupt your
precious storylines all the time

316
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:10,265
when they want to
shoot or fuck something.

317
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:11,882
No, when they want to.

318
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:16,220
We sell complete immersion in
100 interconnected narratives.

319
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:19,622
A relentless fucking experience.

320
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,824
Now, you pull one character,
the overall story adjusts.

321
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:26,130
You pull 200 at once,
and it's a fucking disaster!

322
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:28,000
<i>I mean, what do
you propose we do?</i>

323
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:29,197
<i>Close down?</i>

324
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,169
Issue fucking gift certificates?

325
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,076
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

326
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,736
Your brow.

327
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,939
When you're angry
but trying to control it,

328
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:39,414
the fine muscles
pull into a little arc.

329
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:41,214
It's elegant.

330
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,446
Would you mind if I recorded it?

331
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:45,488
I'd love to show it to my team.

332
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:48,921
- No, Bernard, you may not record it...
<i>- Ah, there it is again.</i>

333
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,154
Hmm.

334
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:54,429
We have 1,400
guests in the park.

335
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,792
I need to know if
they're in any danger.

336
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,762
His core code is intact,

337
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:01,964
which means he
can't hurt a guest.

338
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,075
He literally
couldn't hurt a fly.

339
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:08,778
All he can do is that.

340
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,916
All right, Bernie.

341
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:15,053
Run your diagnostic.

342
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,748
In the meantime,

343
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,920
there's so much as an unscripted
sneeze, I want to know about it.

344
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:44,907
This place is fucking wild.

345
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:47,012
<i>This is basic.</i>

346
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,446
<i>Level one.</i>

347
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:54,153
You ride out of town, that's when
the real demented shit begins.

348
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:56,121
That's where my
man Teddy comes in.

349
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:58,194
He's like a...
He's like a guide.

350
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,232
Honestly,

351
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:03,834
the guy kind of creeps me out.

352
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,068
Fuck it, he leads us out in
the canyons, we get bored,

353
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:11,335
and we just use him
for target practice.

354
00:30:26,892 --> 00:30:29,212
<i>I don't think we're supposed
to be cross the river.</i>

355
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:30,885
<i>It's too adult for Jacob.</i>

356
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,156
We didn't mean to bother you.

357
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,099
No bother at all.

358
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:38,328
It's a beautiful spot.

359
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,200
I always find it a shame
that I have it all to myself.

360
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:47,345
They come here every day.

361
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,943
Would you like a closer look?

362
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:08,428
Don't be scared.
They're very gentle.

363
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,926
Here, put your
hand out real flat.

364
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,568
They're beautiful, aren't they?

365
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:21,352
You're one of them, aren't you?

366
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:24,172
You're not real.

367
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:30,649
I have to go now.

368
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,252
Sun's almost down.

369
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,150
You should, too.

370
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:35,726
There're bandits in these hills.

371
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:49,731
Here we go!

372
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,920
You waiting up for me, Daddy?

373
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:41,990
I told you I'd be
home before dark.

374
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,355
I found this in the field today.

375
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:53,034
Doesn't look like
anything to me.

376
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:54,730
<i>But, where is she?</i>

377
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,305
Have you ever seen
anything like this place?

378
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,312
Doesn't look like
anything to me.

379
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:06,246
I'm gonna help
Mama put supper on.

380
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:24,926
I had the same thought.

381
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:28,333
Needed a little sunshine
before turning in.

382
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:32,073
So, when do you get
to rotate home again?

383
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:37,474
If you're this bad at writing small
talk, how the fuck did you get your job?

384
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:38,840
Get to the point.

385
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:43,954
I wanted to apologize if I
came across as aggressive.

386
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,068
And I wanted to talk
to you about the update.

387
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:48,219
The problem's been resolved.

388
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:50,725
There should never have
been an update in the first place.

389
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:54,528
Ford and Bernard keep
making the things more lifelike.

390
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,927
But does anyone truly want that?

391
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,947
Do you want to think that your husband
is really fucking that beautiful girl

392
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:02,372
or that you really
just shot someone?

393
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,909
This place works because the
guests know the hosts aren't real.

394
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,976
So, what exactly
are you suggesting?

395
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,144
Stop the updates altogether.

396
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,041
Maybe even roll them back a bit.

397
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:14,345
Make the hosts more manageable.

398
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,283
Lobotomies tend to do that.

399
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:20,982
Well, think of the benefits,

400
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,924
in terms of design time,
maintenance, costs.

401
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,590
Not to mention
the Dr. Ford factor.

402
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:33,002
The guy's gonna chase his
demons right over the deep end.

403
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,882
I mean, no one respects
him more than me,

404
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,306
- but at some point...
- I.

405
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:38,477
No one respects him more than I.

406
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:41,408
Your pronoun is the
subject of the second clause.

407
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,790
- I was saying...
- You were saying

408
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,680
should our fearless
leader have a breakdown,

409
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,647
you want to leverage
it for your career.

410
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:50,277
Listen, a changing of
the guard is long overdue.

411
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:53,255
I just wanted you to know
that you have my support.

412
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:54,983
And...

413
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,755
And I know that the corporation's
real interest in this place

414
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,798
goes way beyond gratifying some
rich assholes who want to play cowboy.

415
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:10,532
And here I thought you were only
good for writing depraved little fantasies.

416
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,110
You're right.

417
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:15,405
This place is one
thing to the guests,

418
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,977
another thing to
the shareholders,

419
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:21,677
and something completely
different to management.

420
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:23,786
So, enlighten me.

421
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:27,324
What do you think
management's real interests are?

422
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,308
You're smart enough to
guess there's a bigger picture,

423
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,631
but not smart enough
to see what it is.

424
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:41,671
You know how much use
that makes your support to me?

425
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,004
Fuck all.

426
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,674
Get some sleep, Mr. Sizemore.

427
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,145
You'll have more rich
assholes to gratify tomorrow.

428
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:12,803
Early night, Maeve?

429
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,103
Feeling a bit out of sorts.

430
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:18,209
Clementine can
pick up the slack.

431
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,804
Night.

432
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:24,381
Forgetting something, Kissy?

433
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,919
I'm beginning to think
you're getting sweet on me.

434
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:38,291
Well, on account of you
being half cornhusker.

435
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:44,296
Tell me which half is which
and I'll search that half.

436
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:59,908
Yeah, the half's gonna
cut your fucking throat.

437
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,385
I told you, I didn't take...

438
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:32,476
Hmm.

439
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:34,245
Good as new again, huh?

440
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:37,686
Sometimes I envy
your forgetfulness.

441
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,353
We've got a serious
problem with one of the hosts.

442
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,404
Thinking this
one's still thirsty.

443
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,673
Not gonna die this time, Arnold.

444
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,845
Ain't nothing gonna kill me.

445
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,091
<i>You can't have none.</i>

446
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:23,696
Ain't for you.

447
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,988
Found me another bottle.

448
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,605
You're a growing boy.

449
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:04,171
A growing boy.

450
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,369
Growing boy!

451
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,420
We got two guests inside.

452
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:25,620
We'll go talk to them,
you sort this mess out.

453
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:30,265
You know... They're
supposed to turn on each other,

454
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:33,128
<i>but only if the guest takes
them on the High Sierra storyline,</i>

455
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,535
and Walter always buys it.

456
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:38,834
Well, I guess Walter
got tired of buying it.

457
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:44,415
I suppose this means the
sheriff wasn't an isolated incident.

458
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:48,282
Hey, it's good news, really.

459
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,512
Confirms the problem
was part of the update.

460
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:54,924
We can roll them
back, clean them up,

461
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:56,791
put them back in service.

462
00:39:58,162 --> 00:39:59,460
You think I'm gonna sign off on

463
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:02,294
this fucking homicidal thing
going back into service?

464
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:04,333
It's homicidal by design.

465
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,334
Walter kills other
hosts all the time.

466
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:11,736
I'll admit the method here
is a little unconventional,

467
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,742
but it didn't hurt a guest.

468
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,973
The hosts are supposed
to stay within their loops,

469
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:21,017
stick to their scripts
with minor improvisations.

470
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:24,388
This isn't a minor
improvisation.

471
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:26,748
This is a fucking shitstorm.

472
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:31,527
We recall all remaining
updated hosts tomorrow.

473
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:35,360
Examine them one by one,
decommission the faulty ones.

474
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:36,733
<i>What about narrative?</i>

475
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:39,094
A recall of that size
will be disruptive.

476
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,063
I've told our
overstimulated friend

477
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:44,209
to advance the saloon heist a
week and make it twice as bloody.

478
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,944
Should give us cover to
recall the remaining hosts,

479
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,704
and the guests will love it.

480
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,871
I'm not sure Ford will approve.

481
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:54,577
I'm not sure either, which is why
you get to be the one to tell him.

482
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,555
This is your fuckup, Bernie.

483
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,114
Only seems fair.

484
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,469
<i>So, our creatures
have been misbehaving,</i>

485
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,269
and you haven't
yet isolated the bug?

486
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:20,773
That's so unlike you, Bernard.

487
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:26,768
Unless, of course, you have and
are simply embarrassed by the result.

488
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:31,913
It's the code you added, sir.

489
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,655
The reveries.

490
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,587
It has some, er...

491
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:40,754
"Mistakes" is the word
you're too embarrassed to use.

492
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:43,868
You ought not to be. You're
a product of a trillion of them.

493
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:49,265
Evolution forged the entirety
of sentient life on this planet

494
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,204
using only one tool...

495
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,207
The mistake.

496
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,680
I flattered myself we were taking
a more disciplined approach here.

497
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:01,876
I suppose self-delusion is a
gift of natural selection as well.

498
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,486
Indeed it is.

499
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:08,019
But, of course, we've managed to
slip evolution's leash now, haven't we?

500
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:10,759
<i>We can cure any disease,</i>

501
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:13,329
keep even the weakest
of us alive, and...

502
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:18,361
You know, one fine day, perhaps,
we shall even resurrect the dead.

503
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:22,464
Call forth Lazarus
from his cave.

504
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:27,871
Do you know what that means?

505
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:31,973
It means that we're done.

506
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,020
That this is as good
as we're going to get.

507
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:46,130
It also means that you must
indulge me the occasional mistake.

508
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,486
About three liters.

509
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,523
That's how much
blood I left in you.

510
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:25,659
Lose more than that, you die.

511
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:29,136
But for now, you're mine.

512
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,673
And I'm gonna get
some answers out of you.

513
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:40,083
Where are you...

514
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:09,041
What do you want?

515
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:13,210
You know about
games, don't you, Kissy?

516
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,745
Well, this is a complicated one.

517
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,085
I... I don't play. I only deal.

518
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,618
Who said anything
about you playing?

519
00:44:22,527 --> 00:44:25,156
You're livestock, scenery.

520
00:44:26,097 --> 00:44:27,258
I play.

521
00:44:27,899 --> 00:44:32,633
The others, they just come here to get
their rocks off, shoot a couple Indians.

522
00:44:34,939 --> 00:44:37,238
But there's a deeper
level to this game.

523
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,169
You're gonna show
me how to get there.

524
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:45,877
A lot of wisdom
in ancient cultures.

525
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:53,948
And perhaps it's time
to dig deeper into yours.

526
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,661
No. No. No.

527
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:58,289
No!

528
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,164
Morning, Daddy.

529
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,467
Did you sleep well?

530
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,252
Daddy, you've been
out here all night?

531
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,487
I had a question.

532
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:35,428
A question you're
not supposed to ask.

533
00:45:38,703 --> 00:45:41,195
Which gave me an answer

534
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:44,364
you're not supposed to know.

535
00:45:45,643 --> 00:45:47,111
What's wrong, Daddy?

536
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:55,709
Would you like to
know the question?

537
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,944
Question?

538
00:45:57,655 --> 00:46:00,557
Mama! Mama, help! Come quick!

539
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:03,250
Don't worry.

540
00:46:04,462 --> 00:46:05,930
Don't worry. I'll
take care of you.

541
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:14,537
No. You should go. Leave.

542
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:16,230
Don't you see?

543
00:46:17,842 --> 00:46:20,869
Hell is empty and
all the devils are here.

544
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,681
You stay right here. Understand?

545
00:46:33,057 --> 00:46:34,116
I'm gonna find the doctor.

546
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:16,191
You came back.

547
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:18,292
I told you I would.

548
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:23,597
What's wrong?

549
00:47:24,075 --> 00:47:26,356
You have to come with me
right away. My father's very ill.

550
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:53,030
I think we best stay put.

551
00:47:59,777 --> 00:48:01,268
All right. All right.

552
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:04,574
With considerable
effort and lack of sleep,

553
00:48:04,749 --> 00:48:06,342
I've managed to massage events

554
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:09,043
to inspire Hector to
head to town a week early.

555
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,320
Oh.

556
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:15,153
And I've also punched up the speech
he gives after robbing the saloon.

557
00:48:15,593 --> 00:48:17,323
It's chilling. You'll see.

558
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:19,359
I can barely contain myself.

559
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:42,616
That's the sheriff's
horse, you son of a bitch.

560
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:46,880
His rifle, too.

561
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,806
All the banks and
trains around here,

562
00:50:13,978 --> 00:50:16,379
and you fucking
reprobates choose to rob us?

563
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:19,206
Why not?

564
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:23,312
You're all here indulging
your particular vices.

565
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:25,590
And so I've come
to indulge mine.

566
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:49,444
I've got to get back to Father.

567
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:51,371
Dolores, no!

568
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:00,651
Teddy.

569
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:05,153
Don't mind me.

570
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,260
Just... Just trying
to look chivalrous.

571
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,195
Oh, Teddy.

572
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:32,620
You're a low-down
son of a bitch.

573
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:33,847
I know.

574
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,061
I know we both
believe the same thing.

575
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:46,634
No matter how dirty
the business, do it well.

576
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,591
No telling there's anything
worthwhile in that safe.

577
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:19,594
We should take
this sweet little bitch,

578
00:52:20,571 --> 00:52:21,732
just in case.

579
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,583
Problem with the righteous...
They can't shoot for shit.

580
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:42,855
Making a hell of
a racket, though.

581
00:52:58,709 --> 00:52:59,733
You wanted me.

582
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:03,376
Well, let this be a lesson.

583
00:53:07,151 --> 00:53:08,881
The lesson is...

584
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:26,393
Oh, Jesus.

585
00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:36,359
Look at that!

586
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,982
I just shot him through the
neck! And his pal here, too.

587
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,410
Look at her wriggle.

588
00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:47,967
Go get that photographer. I
want to get a picture of this.

589
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:49,892
- Okay.
- Whoo!

590
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:51,656
<i>You're welcome.</i>

591
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:54,225
Maybe you'll get to
your speech next time.

592
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:00,530
Oh, Teddy.

593
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:06,169
At least I got to see
you one last time.

594
00:54:07,845 --> 00:54:10,371
You're not going
anywhere, now, hear?

595
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:12,546
There's a path for everyone.

596
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:16,112
My path is bound with yours.

597
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:26,556
Teddy?

598
00:54:27,131 --> 00:54:28,531
Teddy, no.

599
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:30,225
Please.

600
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,430
No, we've only just begun.

601
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:48,610
<i>That was good. Hang on. Hang on.</i>

602
00:54:48,886 --> 00:54:50,718
Let me get the hat. Get the hat.

603
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:53,115
All right.

604
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:05,827
Help, please.

605
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:07,431
My father's sick at home,

606
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:10,039
but I can't just leave
him out here in the street.

607
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:21,645
Soon this will all feel
like a distant dream.

608
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,560
Until then, may you rest in a
deep and dreamless slumber.

609
00:55:31,295 --> 00:55:32,524
Two more over here.

610
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:35,655
We got 'em all.

611
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:49,439
That's all of them.

612
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:51,948
Any preliminary results?

613
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:53,743
Most of them are
checking out fine.

614
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:59,111
We had one who
definitely was not.

615
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:23,375
Bring her back online.

616
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:36,317
Cognition only.
No emotional affect.

617
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:42,700
All right, sweetheart,
can you hear me?

618
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,693
Yes.

619
00:56:45,102 --> 00:56:47,367
I'm sorry. I'm not
feeling quite myself.

620
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:49,203
Lose the accent.

621
00:56:49,373 --> 00:56:50,413
Do you know where you are?

622
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:52,269
I'm in a dream.

623
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:54,172
<i>That's right, Dolores.
You're in a dream.</i>

624
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:56,375
A dream that could
determine your life.

625
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,115
You want to wake up
from this dream, Dolores?

626
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:01,211
Yes.

627
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:03,851
I'm terrified.

628
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:05,580
There's nothing to be afraid of,

629
00:57:06,223 --> 00:57:08,749
as long as you answer my
questions correctly. You understand?

630
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,890
- Yes.
- Good.

631
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:15,221
First, have you ever questioned
the nature of your reality?

632
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:16,957
No.

633
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,395
Has anyone around you?

634
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:22,038
For instance, your father?

635
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:27,138
<i>He was scared.</i>

636
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:29,205
<i>He wasn't thinking right.</i>

637
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,143
He showed you a picture.

638
00:57:35,986 --> 00:57:37,284
That's right.

639
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:42,650
<i>Was there anything
odd about that picture?</i>

640
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,961
<i>No, nothing at all.</i>

641
00:57:46,163 --> 00:57:48,359
<i>It didn't look like
anything to me.</i>

642
00:57:54,104 --> 00:57:56,096
If it breached, he
needs to be put down.

643
00:57:56,273 --> 00:57:57,571
That's the policy.

644
00:57:57,841 --> 00:58:03,405
Would it not be best for us to
discover why first, Ms. Cullen?

645
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,680
Please.

646
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:19,820
We've run a full diagnostic,

647
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:25,459
but the results
are, well, confusing.

648
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:31,359
Now, tell me, what
happened to your program?

649
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:40,378
When we are born,

650
00:58:41,785 --> 00:58:46,951
we cry we are come
to this great stage of...

651
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:50,686
Fools.

652
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,386
That is enough.

653
00:58:56,133 --> 00:59:00,298
Tell me, do you have access
to your previous configuration?

654
00:59:04,508 --> 00:59:05,532
Yes.

655
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,371
Access that, please.

656
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,181
What is your name?

657
00:59:18,422 --> 00:59:19,822
Mr. Peter Abernathy.

658
00:59:20,157 --> 00:59:23,389
Mr. Abernathy,
what are your drives?

659
00:59:24,428 --> 00:59:26,454
Tend to my herd. Er...

660
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:28,559
Look after my wife.

661
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:31,660
Your final drive?

662
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:35,262
Well, my daughter
Dolores, of course.

663
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:37,469
I must protect Dolores.

664
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:41,943
I am who I am
because of her, and...

665
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:46,077
Well, I... I wouldn't have it...

666
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:53,018
I... I wouldn't
have it any other...

667
00:59:57,561 --> 01:00:00,395
I... I... I have to warn her.

668
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:02,088
Warn who?

669
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:03,961
Dolores.

670
01:00:05,402 --> 01:00:07,098
The things they do to her.

671
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:09,970
The things you do to her.

672
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,104
I have to protect her.

673
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,740
I have to help her. I...

674
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:18,746
She's got to get out.

675
01:00:19,049 --> 01:00:20,745
Very good, Mr. Abernathy.

676
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:22,280
<i>That's enough.</i>

677
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:28,081
This behavior, we're
miles beyond a glitch here.

678
01:00:32,062 --> 01:00:34,657
Access your
current build, please.

679
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:41,797
What is your name?

680
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:47,044
Rose is a rose...

681
01:00:48,612 --> 01:00:49,944
Is a rose.

682
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:54,884
What is your itinerary?

683
01:01:00,457 --> 01:01:02,085
To meet my maker.

684
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:04,221
Uh-huh.

685
01:01:09,466 --> 01:01:11,196
Well, you're in luck.

686
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:13,997
And what do you want
to say to your maker?

687
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:23,871
By most mechanical
and dirty hand...

688
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:32,388
I shall have such
revenges on you...

689
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:35,550
Both.

690
01:01:37,227 --> 01:01:39,196
The things I will do.

691
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:43,759
What they are, yet I know not,

692
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:47,100
but they will be the
terrors of the Earth.

693
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,570
You don't know
where you are, do you?

694
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,981
You're in a prison
of your own sins.

695
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:02,342
Turn it off.

696
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,089
What the hell was that?

697
01:02:12,329 --> 01:02:14,764
I don't know. He's off script.

698
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:16,593
We didn't program
any of those behaviors.

699
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:23,271
Shakespeare.

700
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:28,876
We've used this host in a number
of different roles, have we not?

701
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:31,205
Since I've been here, he's
been Abernathy for 10 years.

702
01:02:31,348 --> 01:02:33,749
He was sheriff for
a while before then.

703
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:36,580
- And before that...
- The professor.

704
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:41,891
Yes, from a horror narrative
called "The Dinner Party."

705
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:45,654
He was leader of a group of cultists
out in the desert who turned cannibal.

706
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:49,629
He liked to quote Shakespeare,
John Donne, Gertrude Stein.

707
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:53,926
I admit the last one is a bit of an
anachronism, but I couldn't resist.

708
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:56,740
These are fragments
of prior builds.

709
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:59,702
<i>The reveries must be
allowing him to access them.</i>

710
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:01,571
No cause for alarm, Bernard.

711
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,976
<i>Simply our old work
coming back to haunt us.</i>

712
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:17,990
<i>Your father whispered
something to you.</i>

713
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:20,157
What was it?

714
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:24,635
He said I shouldn't tell anyone.

715
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:27,335
I won't tell anyone else.

716
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:29,329
Promise.

717
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:36,812
He said, "These violent
delights have violent ends."

718
01:03:38,682 --> 01:03:40,293
<i>And does that mean
anything to you?</i>

719
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,341
No.

720
01:03:42,419 --> 01:03:43,853
I don't think so.

721
01:03:49,626 --> 01:03:51,322
Have you ever lied to us?

722
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:53,152
No.

723
01:03:54,097 --> 01:03:55,622
Last question, Dolores.

724
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,362
Would you ever
hurt a living thing?

725
01:03:59,803 --> 01:04:00,862
No.

726
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,329
Of course not.

727
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,843
Tilt your head
back, please, Peter.

728
01:04:24,828 --> 01:04:26,023
<i>Wipe's complete.</i>

729
01:04:26,396 --> 01:04:28,831
You don't think any of that
had an impact on her core code?

730
01:04:29,499 --> 01:04:30,899
Not good old Dolores.

731
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:34,034
You know why she's special?

732
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:37,436
She's been repaired so many
times, she's practically brand-new.

733
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:39,875
<i>Don't let that fool you.</i>

734
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,642
She's the oldest
host in the park.

735
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:47,877
Come on, sweetheart.

736
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:49,747
Tell us what you
think of your world.

737
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:53,550
This world?

738
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:07,560
<i>Some people choose to
see the ugliness in this world.</i>

739
01:05:09,506 --> 01:05:10,565
<i>The disarray.</i>

740
01:05:14,611 --> 01:05:16,944
Morning, Daddy. You sleep well?

741
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:18,613
Well enough.

742
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:22,614
You heading out to do some
more of that painting of yours?

743
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:29,287
<i>I choose to see the beauty.</i>

744
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:12,765
<i>To believe there is
an order to our days...</i>

745
01:06:16,206 --> 01:06:17,333
<i>A purpose.</i>

746
01:06:41,798 --> 01:06:44,563
I know things will work out
the way they're meant to.

747
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:04,112
