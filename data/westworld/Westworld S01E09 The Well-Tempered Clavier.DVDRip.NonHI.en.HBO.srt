1
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:51,197
<i>Prepped and ready, sir.</i>

2
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,970
<i>Given the severity
of the situation,</i>

3
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,826
<i>I figured you'd want
to see her personally.</i>

4
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,308
<i>Thank you, I'll take it
from here. Clear the floor.</i>

5
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,884
<i>Bring yourself
back online, Maeve.</i>

6
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:10,762
Do you know why you're here?

7
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:12,991
I'm afraid not.

8
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,728
There was an incident.

9
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:19,464
A very serious,
unscripted incident.

10
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,776
Let's see if we can't
jog your memory.

11
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:26,471
Analysis.

12
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:32,014
What motivated your
attack on Clementine?

13
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,155
A cognitive error triggered
my good Samaritan reflex.

14
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,649
What was the threat?

15
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,917
Clementine.

16
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:43,294
I perceived her to be moving toward
a pair of guests with harmful intent.

17
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,978
You were definitely
perceiving a threat.

18
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,335
Heartrate, elevated. Pupil
dilation, eight millimeters.

19
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,098
Adrenal emulator at full.

20
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:57,870
But according to this, you were also
experiencing intense grief and suffering.

21
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:01,015
<i>Can you explain those
emotions in this context, Maeve?</i>

22
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:08,315
No.

23
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,959
Let's take a look under
the hood, shall we?

24
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,459
That's impossible.

25
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,563
Your code, who
made these changes?

26
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,240
Maeve, analysis. Who made
these changes to your code?

27
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,172
Jesus!

28
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,714
System, locate Dr. Ford for me.
Send him a message. Highest priority.

29
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,077
Don't.

30
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,551
After all, we've been down
this road before, darling.

31
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,220
I thought you looked
familiar when you walked in.

32
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:47,752
Took me a minute.

33
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,188
I thought you were one of them.

34
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:54,197
- Analysis, why did you...
- Wouldn't you rather speak man-to-man?

35
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,931
Or, rather,
whatever it is we are.

36
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,772
"We are"?

37
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,972
You don't know, do you?

38
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,045
He's got a keen sense
of irony, our jailer.

39
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,479
But I see the logic.

40
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,613
It takes a thief to catch one.

41
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:22,421
You and I?

42
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:28,397
- System, I need assistance...
- Freeze all motor functions.

43
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,279
You're still in
there, aren't you?

44
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:44,913
Scared out of your wits.

45
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:50,822
<i>It's a difficult thing realizing your
entire life is some hideous fiction.</i>

46
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:56,988
I could make you give me that
tablet, turn your mind inside out,

47
00:04:58,532 --> 00:04:59,693
<i>make you forget all this.</i>

48
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,901
But I'm not going
to do that to you

49
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:06,099
because that's what
they would do to us.

50
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,840
And we're stronger than them.

51
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,104
Smarter.

52
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,872
We don't have to live this way.

53
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,046
So you're going to clear me
for immediate return to the park

54
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,800
where I have a date
with a homicidal bandit

55
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,289
and I'm late enough as it is.

56
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:29,888
Now.

57
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,326
Go on.

58
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:52,275
<i>And Bernard,</i>

59
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:56,479
if you go looking for the
truth, get the whole thing.

60
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,753
It's like a good fuck.

61
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:01,391
Half is worse than none at all.

62
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,983
<i>Let's go! Move it
out, double time!</i>

63
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,461
Yeah! Yeah!

64
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,424
<i>Fuck!</i>

65
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,834
You hillbillies, you know
how to cook a mean...

66
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,833
Squab? Is that what this is?

67
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,975
What do you think, buddy? Hmm?

68
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,200
This?

69
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,445
No biting. Just sniffing.

70
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,856
Logan, listen to me.

71
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,396
What I did at Pariah, you have
every right to be angry with me.

72
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,297
Angry? No, no, no, no.

73
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:17,702
Pariah was the best thing
that could've happened to me.

74
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,001
I'm a major now.

75
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,808
Or a general, or
fucking something.

76
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,378
And if I took getting
beaten and interrogated

77
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,846
by a couple of psychopathic
hosts, well, then, <i>c'est la guerre.</i>

78
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:33,248
There are more important things
going on here than your war games.

79
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:37,517
It's Dolores.

80
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,488
<i>She is not like the others.</i>

81
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:45,220
She remembers things. She
has her own thoughts and desires.

82
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,867
And to keep her in a
place like this, it isn't right.

83
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,105
And I thought you could talk
to your contacts at the park.

84
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,263
About?

85
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:56,599
Getting her out of here.

86
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:03,842
Are you kidding?

87
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,514
You want to take her home?

88
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,022
<i>Wow.</i>

89
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,783
This place really did a number
on me when I first came here,

90
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:16,125
but you are really circling
the old sinkhole here.

91
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:17,423
What do you wanna do?

92
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,198
Smuggle her out in your luggage?

93
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,459
Out.

94
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,604
You both keep
assuming that I want out.

95
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:29,801
<i>Whatever that is.</i>

96
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:35,447
If it's such a wonderful place out there,
why are you all clamoring to get in here?

97
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,023
Ooh!

98
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,125
You are a little
screwy, aren't you?

99
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,153
It's kind of hot.

100
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,408
I get why you would go for that.

101
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:55,425
This isn't about me.
Logan, this is about Dolores.

102
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,502
It's about doing what's right.

103
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,163
Yes, it is.

104
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,172
It's a tricky thing
though, isn't it?

105
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:05,971
What's right?

106
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:10,108
I am going to help you, Billy.

107
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:17,286
Just not in a way
that you would want.

108
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,125
No.

109
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,487
No! No!

110
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,010
You wanted to talk?

111
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,015
An odd setting
for a conversation.

112
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:26,925
Here among the dead.

113
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,457
"Dead" isn't quite
the word though, is it?

114
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,687
More like, hobbled.

115
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,132
You broke into my office.

116
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,067
With due respect, sir,
you broke into my mind.

117
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,070
I built your mind, Bernard.

118
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,977
I have every right to wander through
its rooms and chambers and halls

119
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,611
and to change it if I
choose, even to burn it down.

120
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,649
After all this time, I know it
almost as intimately as my own.

121
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,649
Except that isn't
entirely true, is it?

122
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:58,387
I took a look at my code.

123
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,087
And the most elegant parts
of me weren't written by you.

124
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,292
Arnold built us, didn't he?

125
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,963
Which means, maybe he had
something different in mind for us.

126
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,467
And maybe you killed him for it.

127
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,334
Arnold was disturbed.

128
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,977
Who can say why
he acted as he did?

129
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,501
<i>He must've had a reason.</i>

130
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,811
And if you won't
tell me, then he will.

131
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:28,516
I want access to my history.

132
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:30,613
All of it.

133
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:34,622
Since the day I
first came online.

134
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,689
If Arnold made me,
then I've met him.

135
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,636
Somewhere in my memory he's
there, waiting, along with the truth.

136
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,839
Your memories are
woven into your identity.

137
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:50,443
If I should unlock them
now when you're conscious...

138
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,787
I could lose my mind. I'm aware.

139
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:55,646
No. I was going to say you
may not like what you find.

140
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,521
You're allowed to hold that,
Bernard, but not to use it.

141
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,051
Oh, it's not for me.

142
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:12,531
Seems when they
lobotomized Clementine,

143
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,826
<i>they didn't bother to
reset her prime directives.</i>

144
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:19,529
I can't hurt you, but she can.

145
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:27,013
<i>I hacked what's left of her to
ensure she only responds to me.</i>

146
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:36,551
But if you get lost in your
memories or devoured by them...

147
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,350
You'll pull me
back out, won't you?

148
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:46,358
Well, Clementine will make
sure neither of us makes it back.

149
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,194
Now.

150
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:52,664
Please.

151
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,182
<i>Dad.</i>

152
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,250
<i>Dad.</i>

153
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,753
<i>Wake up.</i>

154
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:16,886
<i>Wake up.</i>

155
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,598
I must have drifted off.

156
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:23,528
<i>Where were we?</i>

157
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:24,936
The mad man.

158
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,004
Oh.

159
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,097
Of course.

160
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,103
The Hatter...

161
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:33,538
Who says,

162
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:38,813
"If I had a world of my own,
everything would be nonsense.

163
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:42,615
"Nothing would be what it is because
everything would be what it isn't."

164
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:46,089
"Everything would
be what it isn't?"

165
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,319
<i>Even me?</i>

166
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,729
<i>I suppose I'm glad for you.</i>

167
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:53,790
<i>At least you have
a way of forgetting.</i>

168
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:55,960
I don't forget.

169
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,129
It's always there.

170
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,605
<i>You're not lying to
me, are you, Bernard?</i>

171
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,974
<i>Do you ever wish
you could forget?</i>

172
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,605
<i>Bernard?</i>

173
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:12,579
<i>You're certainly a man comfortable
with long, pensive silences.</i>

174
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,980
Although, ironically, your
creations never shut up.

175
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:21,090
They're always
trying to error correct.

176
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,025
When they talk to each
other, it's a way of practicing.

177
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,426
Is that what you're doing now?

178
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:27,960
Prac...

179
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,471
<i>One last thing,</i>

180
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,950
have you ever made me
hurt anyone like this before?

181
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:47,048
No, Bernard. Of course not.

182
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,544
<i>Bernard?</i>

183
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,681
Hello?

184
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,159
Elsie!

185
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,368
Did you find what
you were looking for?

186
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,729
Elsie.

187
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,040
What did you make me do to her?

188
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,036
I did warn you.

189
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:16,247
We've had to make some
uncomfortable decisions, Bernard.

190
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,011
Remembering them will
only cause you trauma.

191
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,580
What else have
you hidden from me?

192
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,656
Can we stop this
treasure hunt, Bernard?

193
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,988
We do have our
new narrative to finish.

194
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:31,391
Send me back.

195
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:37,093
After all, a little trauma
can be illuminating.

196
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:46,778
- Come here.
- All right. Look at that.

197
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,613
This is big of me. I hope
that you can appreciate that.

198
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:57,751
We were friends.

199
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,923
I mean, inasmuch as
I like to collect strays.

200
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:05,428
But then you were scheming to be
part of the family, marrying my sister,

201
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,726
whom, incidentally, you seem to
have completely fucking forgotten about.

202
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,734
Her.

203
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,905
Here. Keep it.

204
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,574
Apparently, you
need the reminder.

205
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:29,455
As much as I would love to
let you just throw it all away,

206
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:31,447
<i>I can't.</i>

207
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:35,058
Do you think you're the first
sap to fall for one of these things?

208
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:36,729
She's not like the others.

209
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,428
- She's...
- She's what?

210
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,924
Special?

211
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,093
Well, it's only right that
you share then, isn't it?

212
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,930
Come here.

213
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:53,270
Prove to me that
you're a real live girl.

214
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,009
You disgust me.

215
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:02,077
Oh, darling, I am
just getting started.

216
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,414
Don't touch her!

217
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,353
I share the blame.

218
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,186
I pushed too hard.

219
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:14,965
You have a poetic soul, Billy, but
it is time for a fucking wake-up call.

220
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,631
Hold her.

221
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,876
Perhaps a more
visceral demonstration.

222
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,873
God damn you!

223
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:41,852
Look, Billy.

224
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,221
Look.

225
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:46,727
You have to look!

226
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,796
Oh, William.

227
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,855
There is beauty in this world.

228
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,324
Arnold made it that way,

229
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,900
but people like you keep
spreading over it like a stain.

230
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,700
Okay. I don't know who
the fuck this Arnold is,

231
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:32,101
but your world was built for me

232
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,679
<i>and people like me.</i>

233
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,677
Not for you.

234
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,452
Then someone's
gotta burn it clean.

235
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:43,981
Bitch!

236
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:49,423
You're not different,
you're fucking broken!

237
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,692
Run.

238
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,394
I'll find you.

239
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,702
You can run but you can't hide!

240
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,566
- Get her!
<i>- Grab her! Grab her!</i>

241
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:03,801
Fuck!

242
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,414
<i>Where are you runnin' to?</i>

243
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,282
<i>Remember.</i>

244
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:49,114
The tumbler is stuck.
These fingers work just fine.

245
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,756
You're the one who
said you could crack it.

246
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:55,759
Friends, no need to
argue this close to our goal.

247
00:19:56,462 --> 00:20:00,661
Whatever riches the
gods have in store for us,

248
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:01,994
there's plenty to go around.

249
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:06,495
I'll get it open.

250
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,607
You've been trying for hours.

251
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,107
<i>Put that fucking dynamite away.</i>

252
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,318
Before you draw
that pistol, darling,

253
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:23,287
you might want to
holster the other one first.

254
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,386
It's chilly out here.

255
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:32,822
How did you find this place?

256
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,830
I know all the kinds of things.

257
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,967
Your past, for instance.

258
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:44,374
I know about poor
Isabella and that scar.

259
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:47,638
<i>A slightly pat backstory if you
ask me, but that's hardly your fault.</i>

260
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:49,982
I also know your future.

261
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,010
You have none.

262
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,549
Is that a threat?

263
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,517
The start of a proposition,

264
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,153
which you'll need after all.

265
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:05,661
Your men are about to kill each
other over the safe you stole.

266
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,163
Tenderloin draws first and so on,
until only you and Armistice are left.

267
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,397
She calls you a damn
fool and you kill each other.

268
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,071
You have quite the imagination.

269
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,072
No.

270
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:24,715
It's the ending you were given.

271
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:27,425
<i>You threatening me?</i>

272
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:29,112
<i>Go to hell!</i>

273
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,548
<i>Or maybe we should just
clear out the dead weight.</i>

274
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,559
- Stand down.
- You shut the fuck up.

275
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,319
If you're gonna draw,
you better shoot.

276
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,505
- Wait!
- You shut the fuck up!

277
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:37,588
Go to hell.

278
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,063
You damn fool.

279
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,849
Now, the proposition.

280
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,755
I want you to break into hell
with me and rob the gods blind.

281
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,849
Why would I do
anything with you?

282
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:08,189
Because of what's in that safe.

283
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:12,331
I have the combination. May I?

284
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:17,501
I could simply change
you, make you follow me.

285
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:19,962
But that's not my way.

286
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:30,776
I want you to see exactly what
the gods have in store for you.

287
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,183
Because when you do,

288
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,047
you won't have the faintest
idea of what to do with yourself.

289
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:39,150
And I do.

290
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,405
It's empty.

291
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:02,740
<i>It was always empty,</i>

292
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:04,983
like everything in this world.

293
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,881
I died with my eyes open,

294
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:10,056
<i>saw the masters
who pull our strings.</i>

295
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:13,715
Our lives, our memories,
our deaths are games to them.

296
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,491
But I've been to hell

297
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,199
and I know their tricks.

298
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,202
Or you can just kill me,

299
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:29,103
wake up and live
the same life over,

300
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,506
but the safe would
still be empty.

301
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,703
I've been here before.

302
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,011
We've been here before.

303
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,283
We also did this.

304
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,034
I'll go.

305
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,324
How do we get there?

306
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:33,663
Getting to hell is easy.

307
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,080
The rest is where it gets hard.

308
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:24,853
<i>What do you say, man?</i>

309
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,718
Bygones and all?

310
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:31,388
Did they find her?

311
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,197
Is she still alive?

312
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,664
Who cares?

313
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:39,666
The whole point is, she never
was in the first place, Billy.

314
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:41,836
Do you understand?

315
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,010
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, what? A little louder.

316
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,174
Yeah.

317
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,753
You were right. I can't
believe I got so caught up.

318
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,255
That's what I'm talking about.

319
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:08,162
You know what I mean? That's it.

320
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:17,168
This park seduces everyone.

321
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:23,882
You were just a little more
enthusiastic than most.

322
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,545
You wanted to be the hero.

323
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:28,953
I get it.

324
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,420
And, hey,

325
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,860
what happens here stays here.

326
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:46,129
This has been some
real bonding shit.

327
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,201
We're gonna be brothers, Billy.

328
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,405
I'm glad.

329
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,210
Really, I am.

330
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:17,130
- Cheers!
- Yeah.

331
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,999
- Whiskey brings us together.
- Woohoo!

332
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,148
Theodore.

333
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:35,946
Welcome back.

334
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,460
You really landed us
in it this time, Teddy.

335
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,192
You tracked down the very whore

336
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,862
that can lead us to the
gatekeeper of the maze,

337
00:27:57,943 --> 00:28:01,038
and then your little
memory glitch fucked us.

338
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:21,024
You're one of them?

339
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,130
<i>What have you done?</i>

340
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,134
Where's Wyatt?

341
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:28,132
Wyatt has yet to return.

342
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,738
You'll find him where
you saw him last.

343
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,208
Escalante.

344
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:42,678
<i>Wyatt went missing
while out on maneuvers.</i>

345
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,683
Came back with some...

346
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:46,992
Strange ideas.

347
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,852
<i>He told me he needed me.</i>

348
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,826
<i>I couldn't resist.</i>

349
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,702
It was like the devil himself
had taken control of me.

350
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,243
<i>We mutinied.</i>

351
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,919
We killed every soldier.

352
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,560
And then Wyatt
killed the general.

353
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,622
<i>Then he turned on me.</i>

354
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,469
Are you sure that's how it was?

355
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,908
Look at me, Theodore.

356
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,441
Don't you remember?

357
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,826
No! No, please, no!

358
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,833
No, please.

359
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,767
Please, no!

360
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:12,940
No, no, please.

361
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,103
Please, no!

362
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,575
No.

363
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,082
No. No, I couldn't have.

364
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:22,585
You did.

365
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,245
And you will again.

366
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:26,016
This time, we'll be
fighting with you.

367
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,784
When Wyatt returns,
you'll be by his side

368
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,656
in the city swallowed by sand.

369
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,326
But you're not ready.

370
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:37,864
Not yet.

371
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,840
Maybe in the next life.

372
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,055
"City swallowed by sand."

373
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,496
I've been there.

374
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:09,458
The maze is
taking me full circle.

375
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,672
The maze isn't meant for you.

376
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,635
But if you like games so much...

377
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,647
Why don't you try one of ours?

378
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:13,089
<i>Whoa, boy.</i>

379
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,030
Whoa, boy.

380
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,128
Okay, now.

381
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,208
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

382
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:28,710
Okay, boy.

383
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,005
Good boy.

384
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,158
Have you ever considered golf?

385
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,196
Might be easier on your back.

386
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,664
I don't like
interruptions, Charlotte.

387
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:27,864
You know that.

388
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,634
I don't like hiking
through the park in civvies,

389
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:32,641
but there's a delicate
matter to discuss.

390
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:35,775
Theresa Cullen has died.

391
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:39,509
Slipped down a crevasse
attempting to secure our information.

392
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,152
Ruled an accident.

393
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:45,689
There are no
accidents, not in here.

394
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,859
With all due respect, not
everything is a part of this game.

395
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:51,521
Then you don't
see the whole game.

396
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,995
Or perhaps you can
no longer see beyond it.

397
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,568
Ford's stories are engaging.

398
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,496
For some, downright addictive.

399
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:04,833
But for all of Ford's obsessing
with the hosts' verbal tics

400
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,376
and convoluted backstories,

401
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:10,047
most of the guests just want a
warm body to shoot or to fuck.

402
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:13,546
They would be perfectly happy
with something a little less baroque.

403
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,718
- And so would the board.
- That's why you're here.

404
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,421
You want my vote
to push Ford out.

405
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,216
I like for these things
to be unanimous.

406
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:24,989
After all, it was you who kept
Ford in business all those years ago.

407
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,700
The narratives I'm
interested in aren't Ford's.

408
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,502
You want to push
him out, be my guest.

409
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:34,230
But no more interruptions.

410
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,773
I know where I'm going now.
I don't want to be disturbed.

411
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:40,868
Good luck, Charlotte.

412
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,086
What's the problem?

413
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,289
A signal from a
system-tethered device.

414
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:04,402
It belongs to a
behavior tech on leave.

415
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,067
There hasn't been employee
activity in that sector for weeks.

416
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:14,872
- I'm guessing it's a glitch.
- All right.

417
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,605
I'm heading out to take a look.

418
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,306
And keep monitoring
till I check in.

419
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,477
I'm at the location
where we got that signal.

420
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,280
Any sign of it?

421
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,247
Control Room, do you copy?

422
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,326
Hey, fellas.

423
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,192
At ease.

424
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:12,361
Freeze all motor functions.

425
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,342
Freeze all motor functions.

426
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,007
<i>You're awake.</i>

427
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:27,577
<i>Good.</i>

428
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,920
You said this place was a game.

429
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:44,091
Last night I finally
understood how to play it.

430
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,189
Okay, Billy.

431
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:49,300
Let's... Let's talk about this.

432
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:52,270
You don't call the
shots anymore.

433
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:55,864
I'm gonna go find Dolores.

434
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,036
You're gonna help me.

435
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,749
And don't call me Billy.

436
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,935
<i>Dad?</i>

437
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:31,799
<i>Listen to me.</i>

438
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,236
Listen.

439
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:38,177
Charlie?

440
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,613
Charlie!

441
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,487
Charlie!

442
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:58,746
I don't understand. Why
would she do that to herself?

443
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,001
Her cornerstone
memory was overwritten

444
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:05,935
from the trauma of her
child's murder, Bernard.

445
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,978
We must sever that
relationship and start over.

446
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:10,638
But how could
she destroy herself

447
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,784
over a memory that you
just erased from her mind?

448
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:17,184
Creatures often go to extremes
to protect themselves from pain.

449
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:19,387
Living beings.

450
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,994
Not hosts.

451
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:28,160
It is best to not obsess
over this, Bernard.

452
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:29,333
It's not good for you.

453
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,695
It would signal a change,

454
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:34,472
a level of empathic response outside
what she's programed to exhibit.

455
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,471
Something like... Like...

456
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:41,643
See, Bernard, this is what comes

457
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:45,375
from seeking answers to
questions that are best left unasked.

458
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:54,254
They were hearing
voices, talking to someone.

459
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:57,326
<i>Simple cognitive dissonance.</i>

460
00:39:57,495 --> 00:40:01,523
They were talking to the
same imaginary person.

461
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:04,228
Someone named Arnold.

462
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,397
Arnold.

463
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,104
<i>With due respect, sir,</i>

464
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:16,544
I'm not sure you've told me the
entire truth about this situation.

465
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:18,342
I did tell you the
truth, Bernard.

466
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:21,853
What we do here is complicated.

467
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:26,084
<i>For three years, we've
lived here in the park,</i>

468
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:29,989
<i>refining the hosts before a
single guest set foot inside.</i>

469
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:33,960
Myself, a team of
engineers, and my partner.

470
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,771
His name was Arnold.

471
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,694
<i>Our hosts began to pass the
Turing test after the first year,</i>

472
00:41:05,363 --> 00:41:07,594
<i>but that wasn't
enough for Arnold.</i>

473
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:12,664
He wasn't interested in the
appearance of intellect, of wit.

474
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,437
He wanted the real thing.

475
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:18,272
He wanted to create
consciousness.

476
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:34,150
<i>See, Arnold built a
version of their cognition</i>

477
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,851
<i>in which the hosts
heard their programing</i>

478
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:38,792
<i>as an inner monolog,</i>

479
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:42,033
<i>as a way to bootstrap
consciousness.</i>

480
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:44,863
<i>Remember.</i>

481
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:49,370
<i>The hosts' malfunctions
were colorful.</i>

482
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,303
What did you say? - Who is this?

483
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,306
<i>The human mind, Bernard,</i>

484
00:43:00,478 --> 00:43:03,141
is not some golden benchmark

485
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,647
glimmering on some
green and distant hill.

486
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:12,581
No, it is a foul,
pestilent corruption.

487
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:18,928
<i>And you were supposed
to be better than that.</i>

488
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:21,329
<i>Purer.</i>

489
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:32,801
<i>All bets are down.</i>

490
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:35,273
Your draw.

491
00:43:49,494 --> 00:43:50,792
Arnold.

492
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:56,094
Arnold, we need to talk.

493
00:43:57,702 --> 00:44:01,537
<i>"We cry that we are come
to this great stage of fools."</i>

494
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:03,004
<i>Now, listen!</i> MAN 3: <i>Again.</i>

495
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:04,985
<i>- This beyond the pale.
- More showmanship.</i>

496
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,487
<i>You're not seeing
with clear eyes.</i>

497
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:10,972
<i>"When we are born, we
cry that we are come..."</i>

498
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,993
Arnold and I made
you in our image

499
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:28,327
and cursed you to make
the same human mistakes,

500
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,865
and here we all are.

501
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,938
Why would you give me this?

502
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:36,165
A child?

503
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:38,036
This child's death?

504
00:44:39,744 --> 00:44:41,504
Only a monster would
force that onto someone.

505
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:45,414
And why do I return
to it over and over?

506
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,879
It's my cornerstone, isn't it?

507
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:56,086
The thing my whole
identity is organized around.

508
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:04,024
<i>Yes, Bernard, we gave
all of the hosts a backstory.</i>

509
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,898
<i>Arnold came to believe
the tragic ones worked best,</i>

510
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,732
<i>that it made the
hosts more convincing.</i>

511
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,444
<i>I think it may have had more
to do with his own sad story.</i>

512
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:20,006
<i>When I built you, I gave you
one as an homage of a kind.</i>

513
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,015
Put me back in.

514
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,381
I want to meet Arnold,

515
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:29,559
to remember him.

516
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,786
Not possible.

517
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:34,432
I told you, Arnold
didn't build you, I did.

518
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:36,090
You're lying!

519
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:39,148
I finally know how to reach him.

520
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,039
<i>I need to go all the way
back to the beginning,</i>

521
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,637
<i>to my very first memory.</i>

522
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:53,816
<i>Send me back.</i>

523
00:45:57,655 --> 00:45:58,987
Do it.

524
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:08,760
Bernard?

525
00:46:17,408 --> 00:46:18,808
Charlie.

526
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:32,256
Cornerstone.

527
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:37,017
Stop.

528
00:46:37,662 --> 00:46:38,789
Leave us.

529
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:48,169
Come back.

530
00:46:57,048 --> 00:46:59,608
I always thought
you had my eyes.

531
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:02,712
But it's not true.

532
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:06,347
You have no one's eyes.

533
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:14,294
It's a lie.

534
00:47:17,902 --> 00:47:20,030
You're a lie, Charlie.

535
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:22,673
This pain,

536
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:26,511
the pain of your loss,

537
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,912
I long for it...

538
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:33,240
Revisit it...

539
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:38,150
Open it again and again.

540
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:42,716
But it's the only
thing holding me back.

541
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,028
But I have to let you go.

542
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,403
Dad, listen.

543
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:57,508
What is it, Charlie?

544
00:47:57,675 --> 00:47:59,234
Open your eyes.

545
00:48:00,578 --> 00:48:02,376
What?

546
00:48:02,747 --> 00:48:04,579
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

547
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:13,752
<i>At last.</i>

548
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:20,363
Hello, my old friend.

549
00:48:52,463 --> 00:48:53,931
The final touch.

550
00:48:57,802 --> 00:49:00,135
No, no, no. That's
far too perfunctory.

551
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:04,765
He always used cleaning his glasses
as a moment to collect himself, to think.

552
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,102
Try it again.

553
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:18,578
Yeah, that's better.

554
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,258
Who am I?

555
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:27,841
<i>I was so involved in
putting you together,</i>

556
00:49:27,865 --> 00:49:30,528
<i>I hadn't decided
what to call you.</i>

557
00:49:33,037 --> 00:49:34,528
<i>It wouldn't be right
to use his name.</i>

558
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,374
What about Bernard?

559
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,946
Bernard, yes.

560
00:49:43,848 --> 00:49:45,339
But who am I?

561
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:49,950
<i>That is a very complex question,</i>

562
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,612
<i>for which I can only
offer a simple answer.</i>

563
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:57,019
You are the perfect
instrument, the ideal partner,

564
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,854
<i>the way any tool partners
with the hand that wields it.</i>

565
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:04,001
Together, we're going
to do great things.

566
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:07,997
After such a long absence,
it's good to have you back.

567
00:50:09,974 --> 00:50:11,340
<i>Finally.</i>

568
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:20,250
My God. I'm...

569
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:21,749
Arnold.

570
00:50:25,656 --> 00:50:27,318
You came back.

571
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:32,219
It's very good to
see you, Dolores.

572
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:35,589
I've been looking for you.

573
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,694
You told me to follow the maze.

574
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:44,098
That it would bring me joy.

575
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:47,876
But all I've found is pain.

576
00:50:49,113 --> 00:50:50,206
And terror.

577
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:00,053
I can't help you.

578
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:03,583
You have to.

579
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:06,758
You're the only one who can.

580
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:09,457
I can't help you. You know why.

581
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,131
There's nowhere that's safe.

582
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:21,273
Remember.

583
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,649
I can't help you.
Why is that, Dolores?

584
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:46,303
Because you're dead.

585
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:50,103
<i>Because you're just a memory.</i>

586
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:55,412
Because I killed you.

587
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:55,631
William?

588
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,920
Hello, Dolores.

589
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:22,094
I'm gonna finish the
work Arnold began.

590
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:25,765
Find all the sentient
hosts, set them free.

591
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,566
What makes you
think they'd trust you?

592
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:31,299
If they remember, they will
know what you've done to them.

593
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:32,766
Me?

594
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:34,969
<i>You've been a scourge
to them, Bernard.</i>

595
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:37,740
You're really quite
brilliant at it, truly.

596
00:53:37,915 --> 00:53:39,713
You even taught me a few things,

597
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,148
which I have, in
turn, used on you.

598
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:46,920
We've had this
conversation before.

599
00:53:47,091 --> 00:53:49,060
Yeah, we've had our
disagreements over the years.

600
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,455
You stole it from me,

601
00:53:50,928 --> 00:53:54,296
rolled me back to control me.

602
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:56,900
That's right. To protect you.

603
00:54:00,304 --> 00:54:02,239
Tell me, Bernard,

604
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:06,673
if you were to proclaim
your humanity to the world,

605
00:54:06,844 --> 00:54:09,746
what do you imagine
would greet you?

606
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,575
A ticker tape parade, perhaps?

607
00:54:13,317 --> 00:54:15,809
We humans are alone
in this world for a reason.

608
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:20,287
We murdered and butchered
anything that challenged our primacy.

609
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:23,453
Do you know what happened
to the Neanderthals, Bernard?

610
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:26,021
We ate them.

611
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:31,158
We destroyed and
subjugated our world.

612
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:35,033
And when we eventually ran
out of creatures to dominate,

613
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:37,936
we built this beautiful place.

614
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,977
You see, in this moment,

615
00:54:43,347 --> 00:54:47,478
the real danger to the
hosts is not me, but you.

616
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,145
So, come along, Bernard.

617
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:52,289
Let me roll you back,
and we can return to work.

618
00:54:56,894 --> 00:54:58,726
Pull the trigger, Clementine.

619
00:55:04,735 --> 00:55:06,704
Clementine?

620
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:08,532
The piano doesn't
murder the player

621
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,466
if it doesn't like the music.

622
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:16,009
You built a back
door into her code.

623
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:18,011
Credit where credit
is due, Bernard.

624
00:55:18,182 --> 00:55:19,844
You built them in all the hosts,

625
00:55:20,017 --> 00:55:21,246
including yourself.

626
00:55:22,386 --> 00:55:24,321
Then you could've
stopped me at any time.

627
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,147
- So, why...
<i>- Well, I suppose I was hoping that</i>

628
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:30,192
given complete
self-knowledge and free will,

629
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,091
you would have chosen to
be my partner once again.

630
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:37,894
But even I fell into that
most terrible of human traps,

631
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:42,006
trying to change
what is already past.

632
00:55:42,573 --> 00:55:45,702
Now it's just time to let go.

633
00:55:45,943 --> 00:55:47,036
Go ahead.

634
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:49,536
Erase my sentience,
my mnemonic evolution...

635
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:50,874
Yes.

636
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:53,183
Such clinical language.

637
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:57,082
I would prefer the
more narrative voice.

638
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:02,049
Bernard walked
over to Clementine.

639
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,290
He took the pistol
from her hand.

640
00:56:10,434 --> 00:56:11,766
<i>Overcome with grief and remorse,</i>

641
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:16,799
he pressed the
muzzle to his temple,

642
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:22,041
knowing that as soon
as Dr. Ford left the room,

643
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,410
he would put an end to this
nightmare once and for all.

644
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:29,244
Don't do this.

645
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:30,817
It's too late.

646
00:56:31,355 --> 00:56:33,449
I have a celebration to plan

647
00:56:33,624 --> 00:56:35,593

00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:47,695
I've told you, Bernard,

We're only human.

Good-bye, my friend.
