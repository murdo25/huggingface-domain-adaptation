1
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:45,864
<i>Dad.</i>

2
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,833
<i>Dad, wake up.</i>

3
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:52,872
<i>Wake up.</i>

4
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,812
I must've drifted off.

5
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,413
<i>- Where were we?</i>
- The mad man.

6
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:03,589
<i>Oh...</i>

7
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,584
Of course.

8
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:12,332
The Hatter who says,

9
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:16,697
"If I had a world of my own,
everything would be nonsense.

10
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,530
<i>"Nothing would be what it is,</i>

11
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,833
"because everything
would be what it isn't."

12
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,374
<i>"Everything would
be what it isn't"?</i>

13
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,438
Even me.

14
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:29,508
Hey.

15
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,549
You're perfect.

16
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:35,920
You're gonna beat this.

17
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:38,057
Hmm?

18
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,251
I promise you.

19
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,189
Now, let's skip
to something fun.

20
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,127
Dad.

21
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,568
- What is it, Charlie?
- Listen to me.

22
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:54,902
Listen.

23
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:58,971
Charlie?

24
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:01,814
Charlie!

25
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:26,664
<i>And finally, have you ever
questioned the nature of your reality?</i>

26
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,307
No.

27
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:32,405
Good.

28
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,118
Now, then, I see you
had a blacklisted exchange

29
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:43,348
with a guest in the
course of your narrative.

30
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:45,922
Can you tell me what happened?

31
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:49,494
He said he wanted to cut off a piece
of me to take home in his carry-on.

32
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,792
That he wanted to mount it on the
hood of his car for his friends to see.

33
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:57,296
I told him if he
wanted a trophy,

34
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,799
I could cut pieces of him off and
let him fish for them in the Olvido.

35
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:05,305
And did this exchange make you
question anything about your world?

36
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,669
No.

37
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,608
This world is as doomed as ever.

38
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,891
And just for my peace of mind...

39
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:24,455
Anything about these
images that jumps out to you?

40
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,469
They don't look
like anything to me.

41
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,705
We're through
15% of the backlog.

42
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,915
<i>As it stands, we should
be caught up by end of day.</i>

43
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,178
Good.

44
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,751
<i>And when you're done here, sir,</i>

45
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,412
there's a priority request
for him from management.

46
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:54,955
Have you seen Elsie?

47
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,095
She was supposed to give
me a hand on something.

48
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:01,892
<i>No. According to the system,
she started her leave today.</i>

49
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,700
- Is there something I could help you with?
- No, thanks.

50
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,393
Raise.

51
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:37,835
I'll call.

52
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,833
You're calling with that shit?

53
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:51,585
- Dolores, why don't you play a hand?
- You're wasting your breath.

54
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,948
<i>Girl's harboring a grudge. I
don't blame you, sweetheart.</i>

55
00:05:56,156 --> 00:06:01,151
I did some ugly things to you
both. But it wasn't personal.

56
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:05,128
Confederados and the government
like to call this thing a war,

57
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,830
but they're fighting starving
farmers armed with rocks.

58
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:10,802
That ain't no war.

59
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,602
<i>It's a slaughter.</i>

60
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:19,672
If I had to do it all again, I'd
fuck you both over just as hard.

61
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,545
Well, I guess we
know where you stand.

62
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:30,014
Don't pretend like
you're so innocent.

63
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:33,354
<i>Way I recollect,
y'all came to me,</i>

64
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:37,152
looking to join up with those
crooked assholes and their war effort.

65
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,364
<i>Not our idea.</i>

66
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,061
My friend wanted...

67
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,996
I guess he wanted to see
what was at the end of all this.

68
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,298
And yet, here you are.

69
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,008
Your friend didn't
make it this far.

70
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,747
Maybe you've got more of an
appetite for this than you think.

71
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:09,919
William.

72
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:19,666
What is it?

73
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:26,278
We're in Ghost Nation territory.
Most savage tribe there is.

74
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,238
Those are the folks who came
calling without an invitation.

75
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,710
You mean exactly what
we're doing right now?

76
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,100
<i>The train's the
only way through.</i>

77
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,491
<i>On foot, we'll be
dead in under an hour.</i>

78
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:44,887
As soon as we're clear of their territory,
we can stop. You can come with me.

79
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,726
<i>Nothing here on
out but slaughter.</i>

80
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,063
<i>The user you are trying to
access cannot be located.</i>

81
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,488
<i>Say "message" to
transcribe a message.</i>

82
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,496
You wanted to see
me? Is everything okay?

83
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,366
You left rather
abruptly last night.

84
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,469
Was there something
you wanted to tell me?

85
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,507
No, I don't think so.

86
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,876
Hale is looking over every department
and yours is running behind on diagnostics.

87
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,515
It would be best if we presented at
least a semblance of professionalism

88
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,019
while the board is here.

89
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:19,486
We'll be fine. My people
know how to do their jobs.

90
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,858
If they applied half as
much energy to their work

91
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,174
as they have to second-guessing
my team's investigation...

92
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,564
That's all over.

93
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,735
Are you sure?

94
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:32,538
Yes.

95
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:35,634
Good.

96
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,876
You doing okay?

97
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,082
I'm fine. Thank you.

98
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,195
I'm sorry. I thought you
requested a meeting.

99
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,298
- My mistake.
- I did. Come in.

100
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,296
Get back here.

101
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,740
Bring your friend.

102
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,468
<i>What about you?
What turns of fate...</i>

103
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,074
I could come back later
if this isn't a good time.

104
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,545
This won't take long.

105
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:03,597
Theresa, you've always
been good at your job,

106
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:07,295
<i>and the board has been impressed
with your performance so far,</i>

107
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:10,460
which is why we were so
surprised by this woodcutter mess.

108
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,336
A small setback.

109
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,236
<i>He slipped on a fucking rock,
then bashed his own head in</i>

110
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,172
while basically on
top of a behavior tech.

111
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:21,974
Meanwhile, Ford is suddenly
using half the park's resources

112
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,912
<i>to build some new narrative?</i>

113
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,159
Can I bum a cigarette?

114
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,672
God, I see why you
took these up again.

115
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,646
Let me remind you of something.

116
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:04,618
This place, the people
who work here are nothing.

117
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:09,023
Our interest in this place is
entirely in the intellectual property.

118
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:10,886
The code.

119
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:16,231
- The hosts' minds, the storylines...
<i>- I don't give a rat's ass about the hosts.</i>

120
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,562
It's our little research
project that Delos cares about.

121
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,808
That's where the real value is.

122
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,909
<i>And due to a lack of foresight
on part of one of my predecessors,</i>

123
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,677
35 years of information,
raw information, exists here.

124
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:35,485
Nowhere else. Ford
has always ensured that.

125
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:40,690
Now, you are a
smart enough woman.

126
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:44,227
Tell me, why would we
need you to secure all of it?

127
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,200
Because you're
going to fire him.

128
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:52,004
You don't fire someone
who created an empire.

129
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,106
You ask him to retire politely.

130
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,903
And if that person has the
ability to snap his fingers

131
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:59,910
and erase the
value of that empire,

132
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,742
you have to make sure
you have a contingency.

133
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,750
So, you and I need to ensure that by
the time the rest of the board arrives,

134
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,115
we are on course
for that transition.

135
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,590
Okay?

136
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,259
<i>I like you.</i>

137
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:17,356
Well, not personally,
but I like you for this job,

138
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,125
<i>which is why I'm gonna give you
another chance to get a handle on</i>

139
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,392
this particular
bitch of a situation.

140
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,797
But the gods...

141
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:29,540
They require a blood sacrifice.

142
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:34,139
<i>We need to demonstrate just how
dangerous Ford's creations can be.</i>

143
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:37,308
No.

144
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:41,050
No, nothing so obvious.

145
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,783
We need someone
thoroughly unexpected.

146
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:15,474
I told you never open your mouth that
wide unless someone's paying you for it.

147
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,408
<i>Sorry, Maeve.</i>

148
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,652
I didn't sleep much last night.

149
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,316
What are these
nightmares you have about?

150
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,256
Do you ever dream
you're someone else?

151
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,166
I don't think so.

152
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:36,701
Why?

153
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,930
You ever thought about whether
this is really the life you want?

154
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,771
I don't intend to make
this my life's work.

155
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,212
No offense.

156
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:53,052
My family's got a farm.
Bad soil. Nothing grows.

157
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,055
I send money back to them.

158
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,615
They think I work
in a dress shop.

159
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,863
What's wrong?

160
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,193
I'm just doing
what you told me to.

161
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:15,801
A couple more years of this, and
then I can have whatever life I want.

162
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,279
<i>I'm gonna get my
family out of the desert.</i>

163
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:25,078
We're gonna go somewhere cold.

164
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,820
Someday.

165
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,802
<i>Which one is it?</i>

166
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,276
<i>It's the one at the bar.</i>

167
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,651
<i>Go. Quick, before the
guests upstairs finish up.</i>

168
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,151
<i>Whatever she did, it
must've been serious</i>

169
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,414
<i>if they're making us
grab her in broad daylight.</i>

170
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:19,431
<i>We got her. Let's go.</i>

171
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,373
You're supposed to be resting.

172
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:57,443
We're riding a train full of
explosives through scalping territory.

173
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:58,770
Not sleepy.

174
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,910
Can I ask you something?

175
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:13,286
This place you're looking for,
what makes you so sure it exists?

176
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:16,928
I'm not.

177
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:25,030
My life before, I was
so sure of the world.

178
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,435
But now it feels like a lie.

179
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,744
Only thing I know is whatever's
out there, I'm never going back.

180
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,314
What is it you're looking for?

181
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,959
Lawrence is right.

182
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:53,292
You could've stayed in Pariah,
or gone back, but you're here.

183
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:55,963
With me.

184
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,740
The only thing I had when
I was a kid were books.

185
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,117
I used to live in them.

186
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:18,180
<i>I used to go to sleep dreaming
I'd wake up inside one of them</i>

187
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:20,120
<i>'cause they had meaning.</i>

188
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:24,121
<i>This place, this is like I woke
up inside one of those stories.</i>

189
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:27,991
I guess I just wanna
find out what it means.

190
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,264
I don't wanna be in a story.

191
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:42,604
All I want is to not
look forward or back.

192
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:47,719
I just wanna be in
the moment I'm in.

193
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:03,359
Dolores, back home,
there's a woman.

194
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:07,368
Juliet, and her father owns
the company where I work.

195
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,900
She's Logan's sister.

196
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,003
Yeah.

197
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,009
And when I get home,
we're getting married.

198
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,156
Oh.

199
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,730
The place you're after,
I will help you find it.

200
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,729
But I can't stay.

201
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:40,099
I have a life waiting for me.

202
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:41,901
I'm sorry.

203
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:44,709
Of course.

204
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,392
Dolores.

205
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,245
I've been pretending
my whole life.

206
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:24,615
Pretending I don't mind,
pretending I belong.

207
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,477
My life's built on it.

208
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:29,789
And it's a good life. It's
a life I've always wanted.

209
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:36,125
But then I came here and I
get a glimpse for a second

210
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:39,823
of a life in which I
don't have to pretend.

211
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:45,597
A life in which I
can be truly alive.

212
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:55,143
How can I go back to pretending
when I know what this feels like?

213
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,497
Miss Hale.

214
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:57,472
I was not aware those with your level
of insight needed any more reflection.

215
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,177
Dr. Ford. Always charming.

216
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:04,506
What is this?

217
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:10,751
Apparently, Miss Cullen and Miss
Hale have a presentation for us.

218
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,881
What about?

219
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,194
Following the recent
reports of host malfunction,

220
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,231
<i>we asked QA to check
the last abortive update,</i>

221
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:24,835
which featured the reveries.

222
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:27,172
<i>- As I believe they're called?</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

223
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:31,410
I'm sorry to report that
Miss Cullen and her team

224
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,409
<i>uncovered some
worrisome findings.</i>

225
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:39,048
In the course of our code review,
we found something quite disturbing.

226
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:45,182
Wake her up.

227
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:51,788
We set Clementine Pennyfeather
back to her previous update.

228
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,623
When we discovered
the build was buggy

229
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:57,735
due to a last-minute
injection of the Reverie code,

230
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:01,203
we quickly rolled all the infected
hosts back to their prior builds.

231
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:07,245
Mmm.

232
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,078
You're new.

233
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,643
Not much of a rind on you.

234
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:19,581
No!

235
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,593
<i>No! No!</i>

236
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:31,102
Please.

237
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:32,566
<i>Please.</i>

238
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:36,272
Help me! Please,
please, please! No!

239
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:38,504
All right, that's enough.

240
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:39,997
Freeze.

241
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:46,813
As you've no doubt gathered,
our tech is, in fact, a host.

242
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:51,320
One that has been coded for the purposes
of this simulation to read as a human.

243
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:57,292
And as you can see, behavioral safeguards
are operating exactly as you would expect.

244
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:00,756
Reset her. Wipe her memory.

245
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,853
Okay, let's do this again.

246
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:43,306
You're new.

247
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,669
Not much of a rind on you.

248
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:17,409
<i>That's enough, sweetheart.</i>

249
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:19,902
That's enough.

250
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,512
Freeze all motor functions.

251
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,114
<i>Freeze all motor functions.</i>

252
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:37,288
<i>Freeze all motor functions.</i>

253
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,080
In each case we examined,

254
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,079
the malfunctioning hosts
were not resetting properly.

255
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:00,304
<i>The retention of data
that hadn't been wiped</i>

256
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,546
<i>overloaded their
decision-making apparatus,</i>

257
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,416
<i>eventually causing
a system failure</i>

258
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:07,924
<i>that allowed for override
of their primary rule set.</i>

259
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,761
<i>The concern with the reveries</i>

260
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:12,454
<i>is that the hosts will remember
some of their experiences</i>

261
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,792
and act on them.

262
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:18,803
You're telling us that these hosts
were responding to a grudge?

263
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:21,571
That's exactly what
I'm saying, Mr. Lowe.

264
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:24,910
<i>And funny you should use
that particular word, "grudge,"</i>

265
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:28,912
since what was most troubling to
me was that several techs in behavior

266
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:33,951
voiced these exact same concerns
to the head of their department.

267
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,488
<i>You put this code out
without proper vetting</i>

268
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:41,115
<i>and without reasonable
understanding of its ramifications.</i>

269
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:44,096
So, either you didn't write it,

270
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:49,031
or you're getting sloppy to the
point of risking the lives of our guests.

271
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:50,930
Few things surprise
me anymore, Mr. Lowe,

272
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:55,506
but this level of negligence
is fucking breathtaking.

273
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,174
We are way beyond
rollback territory.

274
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:03,608
Within the next six months, we'll need
to rebuild the hosts from the ground up.

275
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,317
You want us to lobotomize
them is what you're saying.

276
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:08,553
No, not you, Mr. Lowe.

277
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,450
<i>After all, this was
your responsibility,</i>

278
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:16,890
<i>assuming that you have nothing to
share with us in terms of your culpability.</i>

279
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,526
No.

280
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,233
Then you're fired.

281
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,839
<i>Hey.</i>

282
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:13,612
Morning, William.

283
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,886
I... I didn't wanna wake you.

284
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:26,429
I know last night
was unexpected.

285
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,559
If you regret it...

286
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,271
I don't regret a thing.

287
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,006
I know you have someone
waiting for you at home.

288
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,011
All that feels so unreal now.

289
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:51,014
I used to think this place was all
about pandering to your baser instincts.

290
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:52,957
Now I understand.

291
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:57,955
It doesn't cater to your lowest
self, it reveals your deepest self.

292
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:00,161
It shows you who you really are.

293
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:07,300
You remember the look on Logan's
face when we left him behind?

294
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,737
Do you know how long
I've wanted to do that,

295
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,874
to let him know
what I think of him?

296
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,072
And you, last night,

297
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:18,079
I've never felt that way
before, not with any woman.

298
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,644
You've unlocked something in me.

299
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,749
I'm not a key, William.

300
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,255
I'm just me.

301
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:35,427
What is that?

302
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:38,396
I don't know.

303
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,172
At home, I used to paint.

304
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:46,835
Landscapes mostly, but I was always
just copying the world outside me.

305
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,206
This morning, I woke
up and I thought,

306
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,286
"What if I drew something new?"

307
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,850
I imagined something beautiful.

308
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:05,260
A place where the
mountains meet the sea.

309
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:11,262
Everyone who comes here is
longing for excitement or conflict,

310
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:15,305
and you're just
dreaming of the opposite.

311
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:20,437
Well, what about you,
William? What do you dream of?

312
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,143
- What is it?
- Ambush.

313
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:02,613
Is it the Ghost Nation?

314
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,281
<i>Worse. The Confederados.</i>

315
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,591
Fucking coward.

316
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:37,109
<i>Vaya con Dios,</i> motherfuckers.

317
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:54,389
They're making a run for
it! Come on, boys, get up!

318
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,869
<i>Come on, stay close!</i>

319
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:35,573
<i>Go, boys!</i>

320
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:42,346
<i>Dolores!</i>

321
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:19,883
Ghost Nation!

322
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:41,905
Let's go!

323
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:03,688
Stop, William! Stop!

324
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,920
It's real.

325
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:35,687
What I dreamt.

326
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,760
It's the place you drew.

327
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:41,098
<i>You coming?</i>

328
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:45,203
<i>Once the Ghosts is done acquainting
themselves with those poor bastards,</i>

329
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:47,972
they'll be coming after us.

330
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:52,036
My friends here are
itching to join the war effort.

331
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:54,036
Think I've had enough of war.

332
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,139
How about you?

333
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,081
<i>You got a knack for killing.</i>

334
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,916
I'm afraid this is
where we part ways.

335
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,285
Careful.

336
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:10,423
If you're heading west across that river,
you may be leaving the fighting behind,

337
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,564
but you're gonna be
in unclaimed territories.

338
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,134
What's out that way?

339
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:20,562
You're gonna have to ask the dust.
Ain't nothing ever come back from there.

340
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:49,633
We're almost done here.

341
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,760
<i>Why don't I close up?</i>

342
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,138
<i>You've been topside
for less than 24 hours.</i>

343
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:04,111
You keep coming down this
often, people are going to notice.

344
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,978
- Where's Clem?
- I don't know. I haven't seen her.

345
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:10,313
- Why?
- Find her. Now.

346
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:21,458
What?

347
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,631
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

348
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:30,569
She's here. Let's go.

349
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,834
We can't. The
brass will be there.

350
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:39,413
You don't want to fuck with
me, Felix. Take me there now.

351
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,192
Slow down.

352
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:02,673
Tilt your head
back, please, Clem.

353
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,741
- Is there a problem?
- No.

354
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:16,787
<i>Sorry.</i>

355
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,212
Theresa.

356
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,715
May I have a word?

357
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:50,153
Sure.

358
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:09,597
I appreciate your
professionalism,

359
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:11,485
but you really don't
need to bother with this,

360
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:12,953
given the change in
your employment status...

361
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:16,175
The test was a sham. The
little show you and Hale put on?

362
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,454
Completely transparent
from a technical perspective,

363
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:20,427
clumsy to the point of making
me embarrassed for you.

364
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:21,451
Embarrassed?

365
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,111
If I saw through it, I can only
imagine what Ford was thinking.

366
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:27,155
There were glaringly obvious markers
of human intervention in the code.

367
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,803
If your programmers were any
good, they'd be working for me.

368
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,455
And I know you and your team

369
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:34,155
were responsible for the stray
and its satellite transmission.

370
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:39,460
- Bernie...
- I don't care.

371
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:44,802
Forty years ago, Ford's partner wrote
half the code this place was founded on.

372
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,178
What you said in
the lab was right.

373
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:49,003
We don't know
how the hosts work,

374
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,080
and I think there's
something wrong with them.

375
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:53,876
Ford's explanation
only bolsters my hunch.

376
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:58,217
The ability to deviate
from program behavior

377
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:01,382
arises out of the host's
recall of past iterations.

378
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:04,626
You're thinking there's a
connection between memory and...

379
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:07,560
And improvisation, yes.

380
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:10,559
Out of repetition
comes variation.

381
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:15,739
And after countless cycles of
repetition, these hosts, they were varying.

382
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,505
They were on the verge
of some kind of change.

383
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:31,383
You have to know my chief concern
has always been the well-being of this park

384
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:33,315
and the people in it.

385
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:35,353
I know.

386
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,722
Which is why I need
to show you something.

387
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:55,873
<i>Talk to her.</i> LUTZ: <i>You first.</i>

388
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:08,885
Look, I didn't
want to retire her.

389
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:15,359
<i>I know she's, like,
your friend, or... I guess.</i>

390
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,973
<i>But if I didn't do it,</i>

391
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:28,110
<i>they'd just get someone else to,
and then they'd be suspicious of me,</i>

392
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,645
<i>so, I said yes,
but I did it for you.</i>

393
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:40,225
Always doing things for
other people, aren't you?

394
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,127
Time to do one more thing.

395
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
What?

396
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:54,163
All my life, I've prided
myself on being a survivor.

397
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,104
But surviving is
just another loop.

398
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,341
I'm getting out of here.

399
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,913
You two are going to help me.

400
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,448
No. Do...

401
00:43:15,827 --> 00:43:20,265
Do you know how far these
people will go to protect their IP?

402
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:26,661
Every part of this building,
including the skin on your back,

403
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:29,865
is made to keep you here.

404
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,777
It'd be a suicide mission.

405
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:44,719
At first, I thought you
and the others were gods.

406
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:49,619
Then I realized you're just men.

407
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,031
And I know men.

408
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:00,162
You think I'm scared of death?

409
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,070
I've done it a million times.

410
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:08,572
I'm fucking great at it.

411
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,544
How many times have you died?

412
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:18,179
'Cause, if you don't help me,

413
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:20,881
I'll kill you.

414
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:32,827
If there's a problem in the park,
should we bring a security team?

415
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:38,866
Who would we trust? Thought
I could trust you, for instance.

416
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,939
I'm not going to explain
myself to you, Bernard.

417
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,951
I was charged with safeguarding
the park's intellectual property.

418
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:51,111
Why would it be in danger? You
were the only one who was stealing it.

419
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:56,359
Delos owns the hosts' minds,
the storylines, decades of work.

420
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:59,595
Ford never allowed any of
it to be backed up off-site.

421
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:01,237
All of this could've
been destroyed.

422
00:45:01,399 --> 00:45:03,527
In the event of what?

423
00:45:03,935 --> 00:45:05,597
Ford is done, Bernard.

424
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:09,236
The board has indulged him
for long enough. He is done.

425
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,068
The corporation was concerned

426
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:13,938
he'd destroy all of the park's
IP on his way out the door.

427
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:17,240
You think I would've let him destroy
all of the hosts, all of our work?

428
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:20,976
There's far more at stake
here than the hosts' profiles.

429
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:25,152
Do you really think the
corporation's interest here

430
00:45:25,323 --> 00:45:28,259
are tourists playing cowboy?

431
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:36,257
The longer I work here, the
more I think I understand the hosts.

432
00:45:37,635 --> 00:45:40,571
It's the human beings
who confuse me.

433
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:18,804
This building isn't in
any survey of the park.

434
00:46:19,043 --> 00:46:21,808
That's because we use hosts
to do most of the surveys.

435
00:46:22,213 --> 00:46:24,341
They're programed
to ignore this place.

436
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:28,344
They literally couldn't see it
if they were staring right at it.

437
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:33,314
And these unregistered
hosts you told me about?

438
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:36,983
I don't know. He may
have moved them.

439
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,187
What's behind this door?

440
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,859
What door?

441
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:09,785
<i>What is this place?</i>

442
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:12,863
<i>It's a remote
diagnostic facility.</i>

443
00:47:13,631 --> 00:47:15,442
<i>Ford and his partner used
them when the park was in beta.</i>

444
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:17,401
<i>I had no idea this one was here.</i>

445
00:47:17,902 --> 00:47:19,632
The cottage must've
been built on top of it.

446
00:47:19,904 --> 00:47:21,236
But this equipment...

447
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:25,539
This is newer.

448
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:30,941
<i>Slower than our machines back at the Mesa,
but it will render a host in a few days.</i>

449
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:35,051
So, Ford's been making his own
hosts out here and telling no one.

450
00:48:01,779 --> 00:48:03,475
What's the matter?

451
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,651
Have you seen these?

452
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:16,852
What is this, Bernard?

453
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:25,963
Doesn't look like
anything to me.

454
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:30,172
<i>They cannot see the
things that will hurt them.</i>

455
00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:32,700
I've spared them that.

456
00:48:35,813 --> 00:48:38,476
<i>Their lives are blissful.</i>

457
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:42,784
In a way, their existence
is <i>purer</i> than ours,

458
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:46,950
freed of the burden
of self-doubt.

459
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,329
No, no, no, no. I
don't understand.

460
00:48:58,068 --> 00:48:59,866
You're a fucking monster.

461
00:49:00,204 --> 00:49:01,365
Am I?

462
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,838
Well, you were the one who
would so blithely destroy all of them,

463
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:06,374
even him, I suppose.

464
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,880
<i>After everything
you have shared.</i>

465
00:49:12,016 --> 00:49:13,917
What the hell are
you talking about?

466
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:19,752
Is that why?

467
00:49:23,761 --> 00:49:25,423
Did you tell him to...

468
00:49:25,663 --> 00:49:29,657
The intimacies were
your idea, if you will recall.

469
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:33,769
I think Bernard was
glad of the company.

470
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:36,506
<i>I'm not one.</i>

471
00:49:37,408 --> 00:49:39,274
I can't be. My wife.

472
00:49:43,247 --> 00:49:44,247
My son.

473
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:50,351
<i>The burial. I was a
father. My poor boy.</i>

474
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:55,123
That's enough, Bernard.

475
00:49:57,695 --> 00:49:59,220
You mustn't get
yourself worked up.

476
00:50:06,971 --> 00:50:09,031
I read the theory once

477
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:11,801
that the human intellect
was like peacock feathers.

478
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:15,310
Just an extravagant display
intended to attract a mate.

479
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:20,248
<i>All of art, literature, a bit of Mozart,
William Shakespeare, Michelangelo,</i>

480
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:22,318
<i>and the Empire State Building.</i>

481
00:50:22,987 --> 00:50:25,821
Just an elaborate mating ritual.

482
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:30,725
<i>Maybe it doesn't matter that
we have accomplished so much</i>

483
00:50:30,928 --> 00:50:33,420
for the basest of reasons.

484
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:36,631
But, of course, the
peacock can barely fly.

485
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:40,828
It lives in the dirt, pecking
insects out of the muck,

486
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:45,603
consoling itself
with its great beauty.

487
00:50:49,647 --> 00:50:56,349
<i>I have come to think of so much of
consciousness as a burden, a weight,</i>

488
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,512
<i>and we have spared them that.</i>

489
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:03,118
Anxiety, self-loathing, guilt.

490
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:06,929
The hosts are the
ones who are free.

491
00:51:07,698 --> 00:51:11,965
Free here under my control.

492
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,669
But he's not under your control.

493
00:51:24,315 --> 00:51:26,716
He brought me
here to show me this.

494
00:51:27,151 --> 00:51:29,814
No. He brought you here
because I asked him to.

495
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,623
He's been very
loyal for many years.

496
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,426
Your time running this place

497
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:50,038
like your insane
little kingdom is over.

498
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:53,909
You've been playing
God for long enough.

499
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:56,937
I simply wanted
to tell my stories.

500
00:51:57,414 --> 00:52:01,715
It was you people who wanted to
play God with your little undertaking.

501
00:52:02,753 --> 00:52:05,518
Do you really think the
board will stand for this?

502
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:17,091
The board will do nothing. Our
arrangement is too valuable to them.

503
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:21,436
<i>They test me every now and
then. I think they enjoy the sport of it.</i>

504
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:24,366
This time, they sent you.

505
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:32,981
Sadly, in order
to restore things,

506
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:38,656
the situation demands
a blood sacrifice.

507
00:52:42,793 --> 00:52:46,730
<i>See, Arnold and I designed
every part of this place.</i>

508
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,723
It was our dream.

509
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:55,005
Did you really think I would
let you take it from me?

510
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:02,505
This is what happened to Arnold?

511
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:07,842
Did you have Bernard
take him out into the woods?

512
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:10,747
No, he wasn't here in those
days. Were you, Bernard?

513
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:42,018
Like I said, I
built all of this.

514
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:50,625
I'm afraid our guest has grown weary.
Perhaps you can help her, Bernard.

515
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:04,865
No.

516
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:08,870
"And in that sleep,
what dreams may come."

517
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:12,809
Bernard.

518
00:54:13,517 --> 00:54:14,517
No.

519
00:54:14,852 --> 00:54:16,980
No! Please! Please!

520
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:19,989
No!

521
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:53,056
<i>We should be
getting back, Bernard.</i>

522
00:54:54,191 --> 00:54:58,720
We have a great deal of work
to do on the new storylines.

523
