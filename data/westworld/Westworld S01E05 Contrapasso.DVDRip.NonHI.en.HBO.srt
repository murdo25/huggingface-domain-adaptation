1
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,142
<i>You got any stories, friend?</i>

2
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:56,684
Yeah, I suppose I do.

3
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,479
You want to know the
saddest thing I ever saw?

4
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,818
When I was a boy, my
brother and I wanted a dog.

5
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:11,429
So, our father took
in an old greyhound.

6
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,592
- Never seen a greyhound, have you?
- No.

7
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,965
Seen a few showdowns in my day.

8
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,443
A greyhound is a racing dog.

9
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,646
It spends its life
running in circles,

10
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,613
chasing a bit of felt
made up like a rabbit.

11
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:32,819
One day, we took it to the park.

12
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,782
Now, Dad had warned
us how fast that dog was,

13
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:38,956
but we couldn't resist.

14
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,128
So, my brother
took off the leash.

15
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:46,561
And in that instant,
the dog spotted a cat.

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,970
I imagine it must have looked
just like that piece of felt.

17
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,235
He ran.

18
00:02:55,509 --> 00:03:02,211
Never saw a thing as
beautiful as that old dog running.

19
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,511
<i>Until at last, he
finally caught it.</i>

20
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:13,551
And to the horror of
everyone, he killed that little cat.

21
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,829
Tore it to pieces.

22
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,864
Then he just sat
there, confused.

23
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:29,434
That dog had spent its whole
life trying to catch that thing.

24
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,705
Now it had no idea what to do.

25
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,850
That is one humdinger
of a story, partner.

26
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,053
Shall we drink to the
lady with the white shoes?

27
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:19,985
<i>Find me.</i>

28
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:22,895
<i>Show me how.</i>

29
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,326
There she is. Pariah.

30
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,401
City of outcasts, delinquents,
thieves, whores, and murderers.

31
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:35,665
Once we cross the gates,

32
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:40,005
you will reap the full benefits of El
Lazo's gratitude for my safe return.

33
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,515
Are you all right?

34
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:52,453
Of course.

35
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,425
Did I do something wrong?

36
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,829
Just earlier, I thought I
heard you talking to someone.

37
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,865
Must have been the wind.

38
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,016
Come on.

39
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:23,383
<i>This way.</i>

40
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,452
<i>The farther up we
get from Sweetwater,</i>

41
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:47,004
the more grandiose, the
bigger the narratives become.

42
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,683
It's beautiful in its own way.

43
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,082
For once, I agree.

44
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,552
Some of the park feels like it
was designed by committee,

45
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:59,886
market-tested, but everything
out here is more raw.

46
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,891
<i>But it doesn't come cheap.</i>

47
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,191
<i>Rumor is, they are
hemorrhaging cash.</i>

48
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,527
<i>We're considering
buying them out.</i>

49
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:11,167
Supposedly, this place was
all started by a partnership,

50
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:15,206
and then right before the park
opened, one of the partners killed himself.

51
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,534
<i>It sent the park
into a free fall.</i>

52
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,871
I mean, I don't know any of the
details. I don't even know his name.

53
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,159
You must have a team of
lawyers looking at this place.

54
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:25,880
Yeah, well, they came up empty.

55
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,612
<i>He's a complete mystery.
Not even a picture.</i>

56
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,914
<i>Well, whoever
designed this place,</i>

57
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:34,060
you get the feeling they don't
think very much of people.

58
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,331
Who are they?

59
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,268
They call themselves
the Army of New Virginia.

60
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,904
<i>Everyone else calls
them the Confederados.</i>

61
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,631
My father told me about them.

62
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,403
Ex-Confederate soldiers that
refused to surrender after the war.

63
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,513
<i>Now they work as
mercenaries below the border.</i>

64
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,160
<i>They are the key to this game.</i>

65
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:56,915
What game?

66
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,574
The biggest game there is.

67
00:06:58,752 --> 00:06:59,981
War.

68
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,797
Supposedly, it's at the
far reaches of the park.

69
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:05,451
Now, I've never made it that
far, but this could be our chance.

70
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,589
<i>I've known plenty of truly
fucked-up individuals in my time.</i>

71
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,800
Few that'd hold a candle
to you, sure. But this one?

72
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:17,529
<i>Theodore Flood?
He was Wyatt's friend.</i>

73
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,808
You know, his former associations
are exactly why we need him.

74
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,468
He's gonna lead me
straight to the big bad wolf.

75
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:27,841
I wouldn't count on that.

76
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,546
Aw, shit.

77
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,358
Didn't take you for
the charitable type.

78
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,865
You should have left
him on that tree to die.

79
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,330
You believe in fate, Lawrence?

80
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,231
<i>If the bitch exists,</i>

81
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,376
I'd like to kick her in
the teeth about now.

82
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:00,979
Don't be so glib.
You'll hurt my feelings.

83
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,415
As another old friend
of mine likes to say,

84
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:09,055
"There's a path for everyone.
Your path leads you back to me."

85
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,882
Do you ever wonder why I've
kept you with me this whole journey?

86
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:16,561
Maybe you like the pleasure of
my company, you sadistic fuck.

87
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,423
Maybe I do.

88
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:25,198
There's not a man in the world who
would take the tone with me you do.

89
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:28,038
In a past life, perhaps.

90
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,037
Teddy here is not
looking long for this world.

91
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,439
Nearest healer is in Pariah.

92
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,116
But ain't no way he's
gonna make it that far.

93
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,183
He's lost too much blood.

94
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:41,548
<i>Are you lost?</i>

95
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,554
Our friend here is a
little worse for the wear.

96
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:54,264
Any water nearby, son?

97
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,200
There's a creek on the
other side of the canyon.

98
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,405
Fetch us some, would you?

99
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:02,899
Now, hurry.

100
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,205
Our friend here needs
some if he's going to make it.

101
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,777
Get.

102
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,645
Eh.

103
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:14,749
Too small.

104
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,088
What does that mean?

105
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,621
And what are you
sending him for water for?

106
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,292
I'm the one you made fill up
the sow's bag this morning.

107
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,538
<i>A shame, really.</i>

108
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,600
I always enjoy our
time together, Lawrence.

109
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,337
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

110
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:43,412
It means I was wrong.

111
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:47,576
The path that brought
you here, it wasn't for me.

112
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,012
It was for him.

113
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,997
Sorry, Lawrence. Guess
I'll see you on the other side.

114
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,152
Uh-oh.

115
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,521
Not looking good for you.

116
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:29,795
Closing.

117
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,625
Forget it. I win.

118
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,025
I always win!

119
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,163
Not fair.

120
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,466
All you had was a smashed
cheekbone and an ear.

121
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,301
You know how hard it is to get
the auricle curves symmetrical?

122
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,306
You had to, what, plug and
patch a couple bullet holes?

123
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,003
And a knife wound.

124
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,376
<i>It was a contained incision.</i>

125
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,414
Almost like they were
looking for something.

126
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,651
Are you fucking kidding me?

127
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:02,856
You really think this little fuck
puppet's coming to get you? Huh?

128
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,758
It got off the table and ran.

129
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,024
That's 'cause you forgot
to put her in sleep mode.

130
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,178
Yeah, I really think I
remembered to put her in sleep.

131
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,569
You know, that's the
thing about forgetting.

132
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:14,230
You think you
remembered, but you didn't.

133
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,111
- Break time.
<i>- Yeah!</i>

134
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,081
I've got a ham sandwich

135
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,240
and a nubile redhead
loaded up in the VR tank,

136
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,784
awaiting instruction.

137
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,515
<i>Yeah.</i>

138
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,485
Welcome back.

139
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:12,790
Looks like a couple gallons of Lawrence
swirling around in you did you good.

140
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,100
Ready to get back on the road?

141
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:20,300
Merciful thing would
be to put a bullet in me.

142
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,168
Whoever said I was merciful?

143
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,411
And it's not my
fault you're suffering.

144
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,571
You used to be beautiful.

145
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:32,475
When this place started, I
opened one of you up once.

146
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,613
Million little perfect pieces.

147
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,919
And then they changed you.

148
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:41,924
Made you this sad, real mess.

149
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,858
Flesh and bone, just like us.

150
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:48,363
They said it would
improve the park experience.

151
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:51,036
But you know why
they really did it?

152
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,996
It was cheaper.

153
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,773
Your humanity is cost-effective.

154
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,505
So was your suffering.

155
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,612
Whatever it is you
want from me, mister,

156
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,027
I ain't gonna be worth
a damn to you like this.

157
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,917
Well, that would
be a shame, Teddy.

158
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:11,023
After your misadventure,
Wyatt killed a settler family.

159
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,852
Made off with their daughter.

160
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:15,688
Girl, I think you know,

161
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,156
name of Dolores.

162
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,893
They have Dolores?

163
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:26,499
There it is.

164
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,606
The magic word. Come on.

165
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,882
Hey! Much obliged there, son.

166
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,121
Don't worry about him.

167
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,622
Someone'll be
along for him shortly.

168
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,678
Mommy!

169
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,084
Are you all right?

170
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:30,125
When I ran from home, I
told myself it was the only way.

171
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:37,939
Lately, I've wondered if in every
moment there aren't many paths.

172
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,742
Choices.

173
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,780
Hanging in the air like ghosts.

174
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:46,079
And if you could just see them,
you could change your whole life.

175
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:50,156
Is that what you want? You
want to change your life?

176
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,847
Doesn't everybody want that?

177
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,522
I guess they do.

178
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,325
Maybe that's why they come here.

179
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:02,502
Whoever you were
before doesn't matter here.

180
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:04,836
There's no rules
or restrictions.

181
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:08,698
You can change the story of your
life. You can become someone else.

182
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:12,368
No one will judge you. No one
in the real world will even know.

183
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,356
The only thing holding
you back is yourself.

184
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,380
What do you mean by that?

185
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,509
You said, "No one in
the real world will know."

186
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,288
I thought you weren't supposed
to notice things like that.

187
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,023
Why wouldn't I?

188
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,854
Recently, it seems
like the whole world

189
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,797
is calling to me in a
way it hasn't before.

190
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,790
Billy, where the hell
have you been? Come on.

191
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:56,713
El Lazo's agreed to have an
audience with y'all tomorrow.

192
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,484
In the meantime, there's
a brothel I recommend.

193
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,251
<i>Ooh. They have a contortionist.</i>

194
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:04,157
Oh, I don't think Dolores
would find that very interesting.

195
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,992
Who the fuck cares
what Dolores wants?

196
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,429
She's a goddamn doll!

197
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:10,593
Can you not say that around her?

198
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:14,501
I swear, I feel like
she understands.

199
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,573
Of course you do.

200
00:16:56,582 --> 00:17:00,349
<i>May you rest in a deep
and dreamless slumber.</i>

201
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,994
<i>Hello, Dolores.</i>

202
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,432
Do you know where you are?

203
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,769
- I'm in a dream.
<i>- Yes, Dolores.</i>

204
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,965
You're in my dream.

205
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:26,807
Tell me, do you know
what this dream means?

206
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,439
Dreams are the mind
telling stories to itself.

207
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,079
They don't mean anything.

208
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:35,186
No. Dreams mean everything.

209
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:39,753
They are the stories we tell
ourselves of what could be,

210
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,325
who we could become.

211
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,866
Have you been
dreaming again, Dolores?

212
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:51,368
Imagining yourself breaking
out of your modest little loop?

213
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,170
<i>Taking on a bigger role?</i>

214
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:59,269
Well, I suppose I can't
begrudge you that.

215
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:07,279
My father told me to be
satisfied with my lot in life.

216
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:11,014
That the world owed me nothing.

217
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,453
And so, I made my own world.

218
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,695
<i>Tell me, Dolores,</i>

219
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:27,034
do you remember
the man I used to be?

220
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,338
I'm sorry.

221
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,571
I'm forgetful, sometimes.

222
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,739
Hardly your fault.

223
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,476
But I'm sure you remember him.

224
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:41,987
Arnold.

225
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:44,886
<i>The person who created you.</i>

226
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,150
I'm sorry.

227
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,317
I don't think I recall
anyone by that name.

228
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:49,985
<i>And yet, you can.</i>

229
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:55,994
Somewhere, under all
those updates, he is still there.

230
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:58,734
Perfectly preserved.

231
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:02,372
Your mind is a walled garden.

232
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:07,078
Even death cannot touch
the flowers blooming there.

233
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,413
<i>Have you been hearing voices? Has
Arnold been speaking to you again?</i>

234
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:17,713
No.

235
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,992
You're...

236
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,095
You're hurting me.

237
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,287
Analysis.

238
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,228
When was your last
contact with Arnold?

239
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:36,841
Last contact, 34 years,
42 days, seven hours ago.

240
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,241
<i>Yes, Dolores.</i>

241
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,315
The day Arnold died.

242
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,412
And you have no records of
any contact with him since?

243
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:52,418
No.

244
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,820
What was the last
thing he said to you?

245
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,093
He told me I was
going to help him.

246
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,294
Help him do what?

247
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,831
To destroy this place.

248
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,199
But you didn't, did you?

249
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,772
You've been content
in your little loop.

250
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,343
<i>For the most part.</i>

251
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,150
I wonder...

252
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,288
If you did take on that
bigger role for yourself,

253
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:29,725
would you have been
the hero or the villain?

254
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,636
That's enough, Dolores.

255
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:46,611
I'm sorry for bothering you,

256
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,851
but there's no one
else left who was there.

257
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:57,049
No one who understands,
as we understand.

258
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:05,254
Are we very old friends?

259
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:07,291
<i>No.</i>

260
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:11,231
I wouldn't say
"friends," Dolores.

261
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,706
I wouldn't say that at all.

262
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,562
He doesn't know.

263
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,335
I didn't tell him anything.

264
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:55,840
That's it.

265
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,007
Come on, little one.

266
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:03,922
<i>Come on.</i>

267
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:28,670
Oh.

268
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,008
What the fuck?

269
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,282
Grab it!

270
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:37,887
Ah! God!

271
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,489
Damn it, you little shit!

272
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:46,228
Jesus! Tell me
you're not this stupid.

273
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:49,958
You stole a bird and a
fucking behavior tablet?

274
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:53,196
I wasn't stealing.
I was borrowing.

275
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,537
I haven't got the code
right yet, but with practice...

276
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,471
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

277
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:00,973
Is that your ace plan?

278
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:04,378
You're gonna fix up a birdie
and get yourself a promotion?

279
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,748
You're not a
fucking ornithologist.

280
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:09,815
And you're sure
as hell not a coder.

281
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,918
You are a butcher.

282
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,149
<i>That is all you will ever be.</i>

283
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,057
<i>So, unless you wanna score
yourself a one-way ticket out of here</i>

284
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:20,766
for misappropriating
corporate property...

285
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,429
You better destroy
that fucking shit.

286
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,695
Now, come on, we
got another body.

287
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,169
<i>What?</i>

288
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:33,770
It's her.

289
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:36,381
Again.

290
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,016
Jesus.

291
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,250
How the hell did you get this job if
you're scared shitless of these things?

292
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:46,024
Personality testing should have
weeded you out in the embryo.

293
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:49,088
Now, come on, let's get
this thing back in rotation.

294
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,369
Yesterday you
seemed out of sorts.

295
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:01,031
Feeling better this morning?

296
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,206
I had troubled dreams.

297
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,806
But I feel more myself now.

298
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,607
Guys, come on.

299
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,310
El Lazo awaits.

300
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:25,396
I present to you El Lazo.

301
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:32,398
<i>You're a hard man to find.</i>

302
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,129
Most wanted men are.

303
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,467
We saved your man, Slim,
here, from quite a predicament.

304
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,809
In recompense,

305
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:42,982
I'd like an introduction to
your Confederado friends.

306
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:44,644
It's only fair.

307
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,990
There's no such
thing as "fair" here.

308
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:50,088
In Pariah, justice
ain't just blind,

309
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:51,255
she's crooked.

310
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,956
Bitch's scales
are always tipped.

311
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,320
If you don't see how,

312
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,334
well, that's 'cause
they're tipped against you.

313
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,363
Still, by way of gratitude,

314
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:04,162
I can supply you a night with
some very amenable women.

315
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,001
I've fucked enough whores.

316
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,704
You're gonna need
to sweeten the pot.

317
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:16,942
How about I sweeten
it by killing you quickly?

318
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,285
There's something
you're seeking, isn't there?

319
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,854
I know what that feels like.
I'm seeking something, too.

320
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:37,428
If you let us, I know
we can help you.

321
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,334
How is it the lunatics
always find their way to me?

322
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,574
Then again, the Confederados are missing
a few bullets in their barrels, too.

323
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,551
You folks just might get along.

324
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,987
A Union convoy is transporting a shipment
of nitroglycerin from the front today.

325
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,750
The Confederados would like
to divest them of said shipment,

326
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:04,158
but we are not welcome
that side of the border.

327
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:07,694
A trio of travelers such
as yourselves, however...

328
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,061
You want us to help the
Confederados steal from the Union?

329
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,676
They're just going
to use that nitro

330
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:14,416
<i>to slaughter your
people below the border.</i>

331
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,036
Personal grudges hold no
sway where profit is concerned.

332
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,205
<i>Oh, we understand.</i>

333
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,543
We're businessmen, too.

334
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:25,245
<i>Very well, then.</i>

335
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:29,214
But blondie here, she's gonna need
a change of clothes for the occasion.

336
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:31,656
Mmm.

337
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:19,303
My, my, look who's packing.

338
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,331
I don't aim to use this.

339
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,975
Those men are Union
soldiers, like my father was.

340
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,979
I know. We won't hurt them.
We're gonna stick to the plan.

341
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,014
We'll take the nitro and go.

342
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:37,483
All right.

343
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:40,689
It's showtime.

344
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,335
Halt!

345
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:02,740
Howdy.

346
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:06,213
My associates and I are
here to relieve you of your ride.

347
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:10,356
Someone's been telling you boys
tales. Nothing in this wagon worth taking.

348
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,218
The story I heard
is one bullet from us,

349
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:14,311
and that "nothing" blows
you all to kingdom come.

350
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:18,022
Well, then you understand
why we cannot surrender it.

351
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,064
We're sworn to protect the
people of this young republic

352
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,362
from reckless,
halfwits like you.

353
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,766
Call me halfwit again.

354
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:28,263
<i>Please.</i>

355
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,907
Do as he says. We
don't want to hurt you.

356
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:32,320
Yeah, I'd listen to her.

357
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:33,864
He'll shoot just to
see the fireworks.

358
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,680
Hand them over.

359
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:37,205
Come on.

360
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:40,685
Hey. Come on down, give
me your guns. Everybody lives.

361
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:44,516
Nice and easy.

362
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:47,291
Right over here. A
little further, please.

363
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,589
Much obliged.

364
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:50,956
Here you go.

365
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:07,979
That's for lying.

366
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:09,213
Stop!

367
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,777
And that was for "halfwit."

368
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,449
And this...

369
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,999
No!

370
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:42,813
Stop! Please!

371
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:08,337
Whoo!

372
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:11,175
That's the spirit!

373
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:14,480
I knew you would
get into this place.

374
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,773
Yes!

375
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,519
<i>Yup.</i>

376
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,283
<i>Not bad for a day's work.</i>

377
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,818
<i>Vámonos.</i>

378
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,325
We told them
everyone would live.

379
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:42,365
Guys, looks like
Slim didn't make it.

380
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:57,450
Whoa.

381
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,084
They put up a fight.

382
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:05,828
We made them pay for it, though.

383
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,731
Price of doing
business. Slim knew that.

384
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,749
Had my doubts, El Lazo.

385
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,450
But you came through.

386
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:42,960
We're gonna blow these cactus-eaters
back to the dirt holes they crawled from.

387
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,793
Let's get it down
to the station.

388
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,461
No time to waste.

389
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:47,964
If I may, Captain,

390
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,971
your men are weary,
with a long road ahead.

391
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:54,213
You have secured a great
victory for your cause today.

392
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:57,315
Perhaps an evening of
celebration is in order.

393
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,881
Anything you desire.

394
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:04,147
<i>What do you say, Captain?</i>

395
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,869
There's another
train in the morning.

396
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:12,629
You will be a true
asset to our ranks.

397
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:24,399
All right, Bart.
Let's try this again.

398
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:30,081
God damn it, man.

399
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:36,388
You're still miscalibrating by
four centimeters to the right.

400
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,399
You keep pouring
whiskey on the guests,

401
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,483
I'm gonna have to
reassign you to a narrative

402
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:45,060
where your talents will
go tragically unappreciated.

403
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:57,240
Hey, that's the host
that tried to kill me.

404
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,307
- Where are you taking that?
<i>- Livestock.</i>

405
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,175
And then the incinerator.

406
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,853
Fuck this.

407
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:25,630
<i>Fuck.</i>

408
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,003
Isn't she from Behavior?

409
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:29,513
You think they found something?

410
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:32,167
- All right. Be cool, dickhead.
- Okay.

411
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,642
No one's looking at us.

412
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,641
Hi.

413
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,447
You're Destin, right?

414
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:42,477
That's correct.

415
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:46,322
I almost didn't recognize
you with your pants on. Here.

416
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:56,194
What the fuck?

417
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:02,641
There's a common misconception
that the hosts don't log sexual encounters

418
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,070
when they're underground
for reprocessing.

419
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,369
But, like I said, misconception.

420
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,581
Oh, fuck.

421
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:10,977
<i>I need something.</i>

422
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:14,309
QA sent a body down here,
the woodcutter from Sector 14.

423
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:15,545
- I want to see it.
<i>- No.</i>

424
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,853
I can't.

425
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,824
I need this job.

426
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:23,821
<i>Look, Destin,</i>

427
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:25,762
in a second, I'm
gonna walk out of here,

428
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,297
and your friends are going to
wonder what this was all about.

429
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:32,428
Now, your answer can either be,
"I'm helping Behavior track a problem,"

430
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:35,869
or, "I'm a creepy necro-perv."

431
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:37,735
Up to you.

432
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,852
Five minutes, then it's
going in the incinerator.

433
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:52,614
Huh. You took a little more time than
that for your examination, didn't you?

434
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:58,630
All right, big guy.

435
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:02,034
What were you doing up there?

436
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:53,845
What the fuck?

437
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,326
You've been holding
out on me, Maurice.

438
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,370
Oh, shit.

439
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:21,679
We've got a big problem.

440
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:33,049
Turns out our big, dumb
friend had some hidden depths.

441
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,987
That is a laser-based
satellite uplink.

442
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,165
This was in the
body of the host?

443
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:45,135
Mmm-hmm. You were right.
Orion's Belt has three stars, not four.

444
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:49,038
<i>Our friend wasn't drawing
stars. He was drawing a target.</i>

445
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:53,371
Someone has been using our
host to smuggle data out of the park.

446
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:43,760
Now this... This I
could get used to.

447
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,467
You're not going to indulge?

448
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:58,604
My flesh has tasted a greater
pleasure than any offered here.

449
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:00,776
War.

450
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,070
It's that good, huh?

451
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,244
Another round? On the house.

452
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:11,579
There's a place in glory for a
brown man who knows his rank.

453
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,664
<i>You're two able-bodied
men of strong stock.</i>

454
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:25,836
The road to glory could use more warriors
in its fight for our divine provenance.

455
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:27,996
That is just what
we were thinking.

456
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,101
Come here, come here.

457
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:35,179
I know you want to
play the war game,

458
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:37,577
but I'm not going anywhere
with these psychopaths.

459
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:39,293
If you don't like 'em,
once we get to the front,

460
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,014
you can just kill them
and join the revolutionaries.

461
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:45,351
No, Logan. Enough is
enough. I'm not doing this.

462
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:49,651
You actually let loose for once,
you shoot an unarmed man,

463
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:53,356
and now you feel bad because
you can't call yourself the hero.

464
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,500
Don't you get it yet?

465
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:58,426
There is no such thing
as heroes or villains.

466
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:01,437
It's just a giant circle jerk.

467
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:04,646
I think that philosophy says way more
about you than it does about the world.

468
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:12,708
And you, you see
the world so clearly?

469
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,852
You probably think you're on this trip
because you're some kind of contender,

470
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,319
some threat to me?

471
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:26,225
I picked you precisely because
you will never be a threat to anyone.

472
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,626
My sister probably picked
you for the same reason.

473
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:33,370
I earned my place.
Nobody handed it to me.

474
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:37,633
Right. A lifetime of working
hard, following the rules,

475
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:41,713
and you finally reach the
pinnacle of your career trajectory...

476
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,681
Executive Vice President.

477
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,207
Upper middle management.

478
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:50,482
Do you remember the day that you finally
got those three fancy little letters?

479
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,016
EVP.

480
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,326
You walked into my office in
that cheap black suit of yours,

481
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:59,657
and you shook my hand and
you thanked me for the opportunity.

482
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,468
That was the best
day of your life.

483
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:22,884
Right, buddy.

484
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,523
That's what I thought.

485
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,215
What does it mean?

486
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:31,919
The maze.

487
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:35,159
You must follow the maze.

488
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,718
What's wrong with me?

489
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,796
Perhaps, you are unraveling.

490
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:28,903
Right here.

491
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,348
<i>Easy pumping
that nitro into him.</i>

492
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:39,824
<i>Fill the empties with
tequila and seal them up.</i>

493
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:49,330
Your work for the revolution
is not quite done yet, my friend.

494
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:01,505
Careful.

495
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:04,444
Slim always had a bad temper.

496
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,784
William, we have to go now.

497
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:18,725
Lazo's been conning
us the whole time.

498
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:21,776
He was never going to give the nitro
to the Confederados. We have to run!

499
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:24,631
Of course we do.

500
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:26,564
That's how this
place works, right?

501
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:29,806
<i>They create an urgency
and a sense of danger,</i>

502
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:36,471
<i>so they can strip us down to
something raw, animalistic, primal.</i>

503
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:41,195
It's a sick game, and I
don't want to be a part of it.

504
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:43,586
This isn't a game.
They'll kill us.

505
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:49,554
But together, I know
we can find a way out.

506
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,562
How can you be sure?

507
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:58,903
There's a voice inside me,
telling me what I have to do.

508
00:43:59,337 --> 00:44:01,897
And it's telling me I need you.

509
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,492
Shit.

510
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,374
They have Logan.

511
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:44,509
Help me.

512
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:46,342
Help me.

513
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,815
No.

514
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:56,889
No more pretending.

515
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:12,402
I thought you had no
appetite for war, boy.

516
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:16,477
This is a declaration of war.

517
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:21,719
El Lazo set us up.

518
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:23,318
We can find him for you.

519
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:26,582
You can find him for
us by joining him in hell.

520
00:45:30,595 --> 00:45:31,688
Dolores, run!

521
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:46,903
Dolores?

522
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:02,184
How did you do that?

523
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:07,127
You said people come here to
change the story of their lives.

524
00:46:10,568 --> 00:46:13,732
I imagined a story where I
didn't have to be the damsel.

525
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,607
Now that train is our only chance
of making it out of here alive.

526
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,143
Motherfuckers.

527
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:12,992
You pull that trigger, we'll
all go up in a ball of hellfire.

528
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,392
So, why don't you
loosen your grip a mite?

529
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:24,465
It's okay.

530
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:27,270
I don't trust him.

531
00:47:27,445 --> 00:47:29,971
Which is the first step
to truly knowing me.

532
00:47:31,115 --> 00:47:32,743
Give me your gun, El Lazo.

533
00:47:38,656 --> 00:47:42,650
Now that we're all friends,
you can call me Lawrence.

534
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:46,688
Now, why don't we settle
in. It's a long ride to the front.

535
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:00,038
<i>You want a sip of this swill?</i>

536
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:06,883
<i>Don't worry, it ain't nitro.</i>

537
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:16,521
I'm coming.

538
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:39,683
The girls are a little worn
out, but I can rouse one.

539
00:48:39,984 --> 00:48:41,384
You boys want some company?

540
00:48:41,552 --> 00:48:43,020
No. Just whiskey.

541
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:53,859
Lawrence's donation
must be running low.

542
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:56,600
But we're short on time.

543
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,597
You need to buck up, Teddy.

544
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,372
<i>I told you, no company.</i>

545
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:11,508
Thought I might join you, anyway,
as I never like to drink alone.

546
00:49:13,217 --> 00:49:16,915
Well, isn't this a rare honor?

547
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:20,684
Teddy, you know who this is?

548
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,619
Can't say that I do.

549
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:27,729
Everything good that has
ever happened in your life,

550
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:32,302
and everything rotten, this
is the man you have to thank.

551
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:37,431
How am I doing, Robert?

552
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,638
Any closer to finding
what I'm looking for?

553
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,110
And what is that, exactly?

554
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:46,247
<i>We're looking for a
man named Wyatt.</i>

555
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:50,085
Killed a rancher back in
Sweetwater, took his daughter.

556
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:54,787
That last part
doesn't sound familiar.

557
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:58,362
Figured your stories could
use a little embellishment.

558
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:03,260
You know, I always felt this
place was missing a real villain,

559
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:06,437
hence my humble contribution.

560
00:50:08,272 --> 00:50:12,642
I admit, I lack the imagination to
even conceive of someone like you.

561
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:16,839
The urgency, however,
doesn't quite fit the character.

562
00:50:17,448 --> 00:50:19,974
It betrays a certain anxiety.

563
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,454
Now, Wyatt, on the other
hand, that's something new.

564
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:31,256
Is he just another stooge for the
tourists to mount on their wall at home,

565
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:34,262
or have you finally
made a worthy adversary?

566
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:40,433
Someone to stop me from
finding the center of the maze.

567
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,808
And what is it you're
hoping to find there?

568
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:49,970
You know why you exist, Teddy?

569
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:54,816
The world out there,
the one you'll never see,

570
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:57,378
is one of plenty.

571
00:50:57,855 --> 00:51:00,950
A fat, soft teat people
cling to their entire life.

572
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,388
Every need taken care of,

573
00:51:04,662 --> 00:51:05,823
except one.

574
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:08,291
Purpose.

575
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,663
Meaning.

576
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:13,299
So, they come here.

577
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:16,065
They can be a little
scared, a little thrilled,

578
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,300
enjoy some sweetly
affirmative bullshit,

579
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:21,536
and then they take a fucking
picture and they go back home.

580
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:26,215
But I think there's
a deeper meaning

581
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:28,477
hiding under all that.

582
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:33,223
Something that the person
who created it wanted to express.

583
00:51:36,327 --> 00:51:38,125
Something true.

584
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:42,827
Well, if you're looking
for the moral of the story,

585
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:44,296
you could quite simply ask.

586
00:51:44,735 --> 00:51:47,034
I'd need a shovel.

587
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:50,231
The man I'd be asking
died 35 years ago.

588
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:52,409
Almost took this place with him.

589
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:56,205
Almost, but not
quite. Thanks to me.

590
00:51:56,847 --> 00:52:00,011
Well, maybe he left
something behind.

591
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:07,086
I wonder what I would
find if I opened you up.

592
00:52:15,566 --> 00:52:19,901
Even at death's door,
you're still a loyal pet.

593
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:28,973
Is that why you
came here, Robert?

594
00:52:30,114 --> 00:52:32,083
To try to talk me out of it?

595
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:34,418
On the contrary.

596
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:39,389
Far be it from me to get in the
way of a voyage of self-discovery.

597
00:52:50,968 --> 00:52:52,197
Mr. Flood.

598
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:57,808
We must look back and
smile at perils past, mustn't we?

599
00:53:10,054 --> 00:53:13,889
We should get back on
the road. Time's a-wasting.

600
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:08,562
<i>Hello, Felix.</i>

601
00:55:12,209 --> 00:55:14,610
It's time you and I had a chat.

602
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:31,888
English -SDH
