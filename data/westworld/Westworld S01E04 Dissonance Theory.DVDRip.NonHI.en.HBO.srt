1
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,243
<i>Dolores?</i>

2
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,950
Yes.

3
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,019
<i>Do you know where you are?</i>

4
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,513
I...

5
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,948
I'm in a dream.

6
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:10,086
Before this, do you
know what happened?

7
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,299
My parents...

8
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,064
They hurt them.

9
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,031
Limit your emotional
affect, please.

10
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,973
<i>What happened next?</i>

11
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,108
Then they killed them.

12
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,449
And then I ran.

13
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,651
<i>Everyone I cared about is gone,</i>

14
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,261
and it hurts

15
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,454
so badly.

16
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,825
I can make that feeling
go away if you like.

17
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,637
Why would I want that?

18
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:58,010
The pain, their loss,

19
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,278
it's all I have left of them.

20
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,011
<i>You think the grief will
make you smaller inside,</i>

21
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,453
like your heart will collapse
in on itself, but it doesn't.

22
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,755
I feel spaces opening
up inside of me

23
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,365
like a building with
rooms I've never explored.

24
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:26,505
That's very pretty, Dolores.

25
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,100
Did we write that for you?

26
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,880
In part.

27
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,882
I adapted it from a
scripted dialogue about love.

28
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,791
Is there something wrong
with these thoughts I'm having?

29
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:54,793
No.

30
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,165
But I'm not the only one
making these decisions.

31
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,972
Can you help me?

32
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,741
Well, what is it that you want?

33
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:10,083
I don't know, but this world...

34
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,711
I think there may be
something wrong with this world.

35
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:18,389
<i>Something hiding underneath.</i>

36
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,490
Either that, or there's
something wrong with me.

37
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,171
I may be losing my mind.

38
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,748
There's something
I'd like you to try.

39
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,950
It's a game. A secret.

40
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:58,093
It's called the maze.

41
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,093
What kind of game is it?

42
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:05,262
<i>It's a very special kind of game, Dolores.
The goal is to find the center of it.</i>

43
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:10,367
If you can do that, then
maybe you can be free.

44
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,048
I think...

45
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,487
I think I want to be free.

46
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:52,950
Thank you.

47
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:18,884
<i>Penny for your thoughts.</i>

48
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,508
Ever had something
on the tip of your tongue,

49
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,096
and the harder you try to
remember it, the more it slips away?

50
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,147
Most things touch the tip of
my tongue, I'm happy to forget.

51
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,826
Except that cowpoke
from Abilene.

52
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:39,227
That thing he was packing,
that was something to remember.

53
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:44,227
All I recall is you letting that
cowpoke skip out on his bill.

54
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,236
Hell, I ought to have
been paying him!

55
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,033
The way he used that thing.

56
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,387
Better cool them off

57
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:11,497
before they move from gambling and whoring
to sins that are more costly to repair.

58
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,995
What is the matter, Maeve?

59
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,207
Something in your eye.

60
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,452
<i>Can you fucking kill it?</i>

61
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,397
<i>What's the holdup?</i>

62
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,332
<i>We need that one on
the next shuttle topside.</i>

63
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,118
I'm not finished with
her yet. Hang on.

64
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,721
I've got another bullet fragment
to remove from her abdomen.

65
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,475
QA wants her back
on the floor now.

66
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,991
<i>Patch her and get
her on the cart...</i>

67
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,726
Most things touch the tip

68
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,094
of my tongue, I'm
happy to forget.

69
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,417
Except that cowpoke
from Abilene.

70
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:44,752
That thing he was packing,
that was something to remember.

71
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,890
<i>The way he used that thing.</i>

72
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,695
Come on!

73
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,219
<i>No, I would not characterize
this as normal host behavior.</i>

74
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:13,338
Yet you're describing it as
within normal parameters.

75
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:16,677
Well, it didn't hurt us. Its
behavior was unconventional.

76
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,046
It smashed its own
head in with a rock.

77
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:23,020
It is possible that it's a
manifestation of its Samaritan reflex.

78
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:27,058
And it's also possible that behavior
takes a proprietary approach

79
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:31,460
to problems like this to avoid
having to admit when they fuck up.

80
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,865
Do we have any idea what
caused it to go off loop?

81
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,134
No, but I am hoping to
recover some of its cognition.

82
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:49,543
We managed to stabilize its wetware
before there was too much decomposition.

83
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:50,775
See?

84
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,047
Interesting.

85
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,621
Is there any hope of actually
extracting something from this?

86
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,321
- We can try.
<i>- No.</i>

87
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,028
My team will take over
the investigation now.

88
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,157
Your team? Are you kidding me?

89
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:11,637
Look, this guy couldn't
debug a balled-up napkin.

90
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,171
If you would like us to figure
out what went wrong here,

91
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,241
we need to be
allowed to access it...

92
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,653
<i>No more second chances.</i>

93
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,169
<i>QA will handle events
like this from now on.</i>

94
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,440
Is that going to be
a problem, Bernard?

95
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,850
We've all got plenty
of work on our plates.

96
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,784
If you guys want to
take this one, fine.

97
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,952
Just get us a copy of the
postmortem when it's done.

98
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:35,522
Let's get started.

99
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,501
You know, I always figured

100
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,967
you gave me this job
because I speak my mind.

101
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,665
- I did.
- Good.

102
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,516
I would've preferred
you not show up at all

103
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,351
if the first thing you
were going to do is cave.

104
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,086
They think we're not
telling them something.

105
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,274
And we're not! There is clearly
a pattern of behavior here.

106
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,143
First there was Abernathy,
and now there's this.

107
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:59,461
I mean, I've got hosts imagining
voices and climbing mountaintops

108
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,925
to consult their
astrological chart.

109
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,218
<i>This is not a fucking glitch.</i>

110
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,790
And for some reason, you
don't want me to tell anyone.

111
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,626
<i>It is like everybody around here</i>

112
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,672
has got some kind of
fucking agenda except for me.

113
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,324
And... What?

114
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,335
I remember when I first started
here. The hosts seemed very lifelike.

115
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:21,504
You begin to read
things into their behaviors.

116
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,540
- Don't be patronizing.
- Fine.

117
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,570
The hosts don't
imagine things, you do.

118
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:30,740
That's not Orion.

119
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,853
There are three stars
in Orion's belt, not four.

120
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,426
<i>Hey.</i>

121
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,533
You must be cold.

122
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,066
Take that.

123
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,400
- Thank you.
- Sure.

124
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,785
We gotta take her
back to Sweetwater.

125
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,196
Are you fucking kidding?

126
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,838
Come on, Logan, you know
she doesn't belong out here.

127
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,362
You leave now, that no-good outlaw,
Slim Miller, is sure to evade our grasp.

128
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,431
No fucking way.

129
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:23,198
You were the one who dragged
me on this stupid bounty hunt.

130
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,409
The least we're going to
do is see it through, okay?

131
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,731
We can't take her
on a bounty hunt.

132
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,206
If you're so concerned
about her well-being,

133
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:34,313
I'll just blow her brains out, and
then the park will come get her.

134
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,573
Hey, hey.

135
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,616
Can you please stop trying
to just kill or fuck everything?

136
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,479
Oh.

137
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,913
Oh!

138
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,152
- Now I get it.
- What?

139
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,291
The park sent her

140
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:49,190
so that you will finally have
something to give a shit about.

141
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,140
Oh, yeah, I'm sure the
people at the controls

142
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,324
are monitoring my every mood.

143
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,025
That's exactly
what they're doing.

144
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,335
Come on, you really
think it's coincidence

145
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,961
that the only thing that you
even smiled at back in Sweetwater

146
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,404
just happened to
drop into your lap?

147
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:07,409
This is why the company needs
to bump our stake in this place.

148
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,510
They can even give
you a sense of purpose.

149
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:13,246
You said the trip was about
welcoming me to the family.

150
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,580
This is business?

151
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,014
With our family, William,
everything is business.

152
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,258
<i>We better get a
move on, gentlemen.</i>

153
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,862
This should be the place,
Lawrence. The Blood Arroyo.

154
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:03,302
Plenty of snakes, but none
of the egg-laying variety.

155
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,903
<i>You killed my wife,</i>

156
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:10,703
severely pruned my family tree, all
in pursuit of some goddamn maze.

157
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,745
The hell you hope
to find, anyway?

158
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:19,681
This whole world is a story. I've
read every page except the last one.

159
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:23,149
I need to find out how it ends.

160
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,423
I want to know
what this all means.

161
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,652
See, now that's why I
never learned to read.

162
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:34,432
Why don't we forget about this
damn snake, head to Pariah?

163
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,332
My friends there can help us.

164
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:42,836
Well, your friends have nothing
I'm looking for. Not this trip.

165
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:47,941
Besides,

166
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:54,183
I think we found
our snake after all.

167
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:07,725
Shame on you. You were a
married man up until yesterday.

168
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,300
Her? Hell, no.

169
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:12,098
I like a little fire
in my women.

170
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:16,208
The only thing she's ever
mounted are dead heads on sticks.

171
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,329
<i>We should get the fuck out...</i>

172
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:27,420
We found some more
food for the horses.

173
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:31,083
Good.

174
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,955
They were starting
to get ornery.

175
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:38,289
My friend and I were
just admiring your tattoo.

176
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,729
We'd love to know
the story behind it.

177
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:47,600
And I like your hat. Maybe I'll keep it.
The horses can have the rest of you.

178
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:53,175
How in hell have we never met?
Clearly a terrible oversight on my part.

179
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,373
Where, may I ask,
are you headed?

180
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,684
To retrieve something
of great value.

181
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:06,889
You look a little shorthanded.

182
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,491
We got enough men.

183
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,202
Seems like you got a
couple positions open.

184
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:32,475
We've got a host making a
pretty big deviation from her loop.

185
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,520
- Which one?
- The rancher's daughter from Sweetwater.

186
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,286
Dolores.

187
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,656
- Is she accompanying a guest?
- Unclear.

188
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:45,025
The boss is disrupting so many
storylines with his new narrative,

189
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,290
it's hard to tell.

190
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,132
Flag her with behavior,
they can pull her today.

191
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:50,775
Make sure everything's
checking out.

192
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,200
Good morning.

193
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,844
It's a lovely town.
Is this your home?

194
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,480
Well, where are you from?

195
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,045
Same as you. Don't you remember?

196
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,983
<i>Remember.</i>

197
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,298
<i>Ma'am?</i>

198
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,806
Got word a girl went missing
from Abernathy Ranch.

199
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:11,441
Is that where you belong? I'm
sure your daddy's worried about you.

200
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,134
My father's dead.

201
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,138
I'm not going back.

202
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:40,910
<i>What's going on here?</i>

203
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,680
Just helping a lost traveler.

204
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,516
She's not lost, she's with me.

205
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:55,327
My mistake. Y'all
have a nice morning.

206
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,689
Yeah.

207
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,162
So, we got a lead on Slim.

208
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:03,200
You can stay here if you want,
and I'll just circle back and get you.

209
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,862
No, I think I need
to keep going.

210
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:10,108
Okay.

211
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:27,360
Apparently, she needs to make
certain this thing they're looking for

212
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,824
is where they think it is.

213
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,395
She said she'd signal if
the information was good.

214
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,508
Guess that's the signal.

215
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,336
I'm sorry if I caused trouble
with you and your friend.

216
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,739
Oh, no, no. No, it's fine.
I'm glad you found us.

217
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:21,347
Uh, I didn't get a chance
to ask where you're headed.

218
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,507
I don't really know yet.

219
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:30,818
I guess I figured they kept
you in zones or on paths or...

220
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,059
I used to believe there
was a path for everyone.

221
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,559
Now, I think I never asked
where that path was taking me.

222
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,270
We would bring the herd
down off the mountain in the fall.

223
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:56,580
Sometimes we would lose one
along the way, and I'd worry over it.

224
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:57,944
My father...

225
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,758
My father would tell me

226
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,592
that the steer would
find its own way home.

227
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:12,629
And, often as not, they did.

228
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,927
Never occurred to me that we were
bringing them back for the slaughter.

229
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,676
How are you going
to find your way now?

230
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,918
I'm not sure you'll understand.

231
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,291
Sometimes I feel

232
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,525
like something's calling me.

233
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:58,434
Telling me there's a place for
me somewhere beyond all this.

234
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:03,848
I know that feeling,
Dolores. I know that feeling.

235
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:10,782
But you really don't want
to go back to your old life?

236
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:46,158
<i>Are you all right?</i>

237
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:52,058
Hey, hey. You all right?

238
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:58,096
I just got a chill. That's all.

239
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,832
Let's go back to the fire,
you're probably exhausted.

240
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:15,414
Just talk to him.

241
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:16,782
All right.

242
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,955
Uh, excuse me, sir?

243
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,357
I didn't want to intrude,

244
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,896
but I just had to say that
I'm such an admirer of yours.

245
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,727
<i>Your foundation literally
saved my sister's...</i>

246
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:32,462
One more word and I'll cut
your throat. You understand?

247
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,935
This is my fucking vacation.

248
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:52,619
Apparently, whatever they're
looking for is in the Ojal prison.

249
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:57,892
These lunatics plan to steal a
cannon from a Union cavalry unit.

250
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,395
Blast their way in.

251
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:05,060
I don't have time for
color-by-numbers bullshit.

252
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,911
I'll ride at dawn.

253
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:14,846
I'll go get whatever you want

254
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,245
out of that prison and
bring it back myself.

255
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,483
Suppose you make it out
alive. What's your price?

256
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,778
Nothing but a few words.

257
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,020
I want the story
behind your tattoo.

258
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,087
What's your interest in it?

259
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:33,530
You ever heard of a
man named Arnold?

260
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,531
You could say he was the
original settler of these parts.

261
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:43,204
He created a world where you could
do anything you want except one thing.

262
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,602
You can't die.

263
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,439
Which means no matter
how real this world seems,

264
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:51,447
it is still just a game.

265
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,517
But then Arnold went
and broke his own rule.

266
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:59,315
He died right here in the park.

267
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:04,191
Except I believe he
had one story left to tell.

268
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:11,995
A story with real
stakes, real violence.

269
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:16,073
You could say I'm
here to honor his legacy.

270
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,336
<i>And I think your tattoo is
the next piece of the puzzle.</i>

271
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,915
So, do we have a wager?

272
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:29,978
You aim to break into a prison
and take out 20 men alone?

273
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:33,523
Not alone. I'll take
Lawrence here.

274
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,555
And I'll need one match.

275
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:38,926
One match,

276
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:43,160
one pistol and one idiot.

277
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,330
I'll take those odds.

278
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,106
Hyah!

279
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:12,424
You gonna give me the silent
treatment the whole way there?

280
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,364
<i>You should've left me
hanging from those gallows.</i>

281
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:19,902
Least I could've died in peace
without having to hear you yammer.

282
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:24,674
Ahh...

283
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:31,144
Don't suppose you have a light?

284
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:32,544
No smoking in here.

285
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:34,482
<i>Normally, I'm sure,</i>

286
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,555
but this is the finest
tobacco a man can enjoy.

287
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:42,122
Hand-rolled on the ample
thighs of exotic women.

288
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:45,159
<i>Perhaps you'd like
to try one yourself.</i>

289
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,575
Choices, Lawrence.

290
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,909
You know, you tell yourself
you've been at the mercy of mine

291
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,608
because it spares you
consideration of your own.

292
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:09,310
Because if you did
consider your choices,

293
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:12,458
you'd be confronted with a
truth you could not comprehend.

294
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:16,353
That no choice you
ever made was your own.

295
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,863
You have always been a prisoner.

296
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:27,797
What if I told you I'm
here to set you free?

297
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:35,906
Hyah!

298
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:40,445
Whoa.

299
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,327
Let's go!

300
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:58,629
Horse thieves.

301
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:01,831
Damn fools shot up a couple
of pokes practically in front of us.

302
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:04,704
Well, the only fool I see is the
one standing right in front of me.

303
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:10,006
Deputy, you have there in your custody
the most wanted man in three territories.

304
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:16,488
<i>Lawrence Pedro Maria Gonzalez.</i>

305
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:18,916
Yeah.

306
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:21,823
Heard you slipped the rope.

307
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:24,223
<i>Dropped some damn
good men in exchange.</i>

308
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:28,026
The way he tells it, he's
more partial to a firing squad.

309
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:30,527
<i>I Reckon we'll be
happy to oblige.</i>

310
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,170
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

311
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:45,844
Maybe someday.

312
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,453
Lock him up with the other man.

313
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:58,561
Enjoy the cigars.

314
00:29:58,764 --> 00:30:00,824
Go fuck yourself.

315
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:05,431
<i>And just who are
you supposed to be?</i>

316
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:08,738
Your salvation.

317
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,609
Hyah! Hyah!

318
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:39,329
<i>I don't believe we've ever met.</i>

319
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,167
No, we haven't.

320
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:48,972
You know, you always seemed
like a market-tested kind of thing.

321
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:53,152
Big gun, tasteful scar.

322
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,984
Locked in your little cycle like
a prized poodle after its own tail.

323
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:03,151
You sound like a man who's grown
tired of wearing his guts on the inside.

324
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:08,460
There's no need to get testy. I'm
just curious about your worldview.

325
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:12,170
Some kind of half-native
mumbo jumbo?

326
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:13,371
<i>It's simple.</i>

327
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,034
I believe that
only the truly brave

328
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:19,042
can look at the world and
understand that all of it,

329
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:24,138
gods, men, everything else,

330
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:25,978
<i>will end badly.</i>

331
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,450
No one will be saved.

332
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,988
Maybe we've got more
in common than I thought.

333
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:36,951
What about you? What turns
of fate have brought you here?

334
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:41,532
It's a long story, and
we don't have the time.

335
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,397
Got more time than
your friend, sadly.

336
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:47,367
<i>It will be a few more days
before my friends show up.</i>

337
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,632
Three days. Normally.

338
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:53,745
I'm afraid I don't have time
for that, so we're leaving now.

339
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:01,448
I've got a request for
a pyrotechnic effect.

340
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,849
<i>Los Diablos.
Low-yield, two charges.</i>

341
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:09,086
Approved.

342
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,559
Authorizing.

343
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,211
Step lively, Hector.

344
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:53,261
- Any last words?
- Get it over with.

345
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,468
Motherfucker.

346
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:44,620
One match.

347
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,788
You're a capable man.

348
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,688
We could do with your
help where we're going.

349
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,262
- Afraid not.
- We owe you a debt.

350
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:55,930
No, your friend here simply
owes me a word or two.

351
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:59,802
<i>That'd do. And a word of advice.</i>

352
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:04,700
That thing you're looking for?
You're never gonna find it in that safe.

353
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:24,288
I was seven when
they rode into my town.

354
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:27,392
Masked men in devils' horns.

355
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:31,463
They killed everyone. Women,
children, even the animals.

356
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,174
They gutted my mother
from her jaw to her sex.

357
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,003
<i>I had to paint her
warm blood over my skin</i>

358
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,740
<i>to make sure that they
would think I was dead.</i>

359
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:49,312
Every one of them I tracked down, I
used their blood to paint my skin again.

360
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,315
Only one man left.

361
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,653
The head of the snake.

362
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,194
What's his name?

363
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:05,227
He has many names.

364
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,333
Most know him as Wyatt.

365
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:13,605
Hey, little girl, what is
this? What does it mean?

366
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:15,365
Don't waste your breath, lady.

367
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,169
That thing's part of
their so-called religion.

368
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:21,674
Ain't none of them's gonna
tell you nothing about that.

369
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:34,056
It's $5 for an hour.
$4 if you bathe first.

370
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,960
Well, if we just get the one,

371
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:40,621
do I get a discount for
being second and all?

372
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:42,859
I'm sure we can
work something out.

373
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,298
Come on.

374
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:02,411
The tall one, I've seen him before,
hanging in the window of the post office.

375
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:05,055
Bandits? Do you think
they're here for something?

376
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:08,522
I think they're interested in more
than a turn at Franny's backside.

377
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,093
I think he rides with Hector.

378
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:15,062
Is that the one they say
lives out with the savages?

379
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,531
That's the one.

380
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:32,727
<i>Taking off? I just got here.</i>

381
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,379
You gave me what I needed.

382
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:40,088
So, is that all I'm good
for? Letting off a little stress?

383
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,783
Who says I'm stressed?

384
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:43,952
You have your tells.

385
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:51,033
Oh, yes, Bernard,
master of observation.

386
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:01,879
Tomorrow, I have
to talk to Ford.

387
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,541
Why?

388
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:05,946
He's creating chaos in the park.

389
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:08,652
And the board will be
descending at any moment.

390
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,286
I need to buy some time.

391
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,456
Some advice?

392
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:16,552
Best to not show him
you're nervous or defensive.

393
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:19,629
I have nothing to
be defensive about.

394
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,660
Then don't cross your arms.

395
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,060
It's an ancient instinct.

396
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:27,129
The belly is the most
vulnerable part of every animal.

397
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,269
It's so sexy being compared
to a frightened beast.

398
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:34,908
There.

399
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,772
That's the posture
you're looking for.

400
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:48,824
Sometimes, despite
your best efforts,

401
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,691
- you can actually be quite charming.
- Hmm.

402
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:08,307
Have the neighbors complained?

403
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,281
Safe to say, they're
asking questions.

404
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:16,516
The rocks would prefer not to
move, but we shall move them yet.

405
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:21,486
Perhaps I can
help you with that.

406
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,687
The narrative you're creating
is clearly a massive endeavor.

407
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:27,363
<i>If you need more time,</i>

408
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,694
<i>I'm sure the board
would be happy to oblige.</i>

409
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,895
I'm sure they'd be happier
for me to delay it indefinitely.

410
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,506
Come with me.

411
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:53,150
You imagine I have gone
mad, do you? Lost my way?

412
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:57,420
We're simply concerned about the
extent of the changes you're making.

413
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:59,491
We want to protect your legacy.

414
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:01,663
My legacy?

415
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:05,462
Hmm.

416
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,640
You don't like this
place very much, do you?

417
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,208
I've seen many of you
come and go over the years,

418
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:16,280
and I can tell the ones
who enjoy their time here

419
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,006
and the ones who don't.

420
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,551
I admire it, the audacity of it.

421
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:25,916
- Oh.
- I'd forgotten how beautiful it is.

422
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,992
I came here once as
a child with my parents.

423
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:33,927
I think we even sat at this
table. Or maybe that one.

424
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,005
When I started working here,

425
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:45,473
I realized this place wasn't
something I would enjoy.

426
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:46,701
Ah.

427
00:40:50,348 --> 00:40:51,441
In the beginning,

428
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,984
I imagined things would
be perfectly balanced.

429
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:59,816
Even had a bet with my
partner, Arnold, to that effect.

430
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:01,692
We made 100 hopeful storylines.

431
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:04,090
Of course, almost no
one took us up on them.

432
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,321
I lost the bet.

433
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:11,463
Arnold always held a
somewhat dim view of people.

434
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,499
He preferred the hosts.

435
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:17,005
He begged me to not let
you people in, the moneymen.

436
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:18,703
<i>Delos.</i>

437
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:20,435
<i>But I told him we'd be fine,</i>

438
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,944
that you didn't understand
what you were paying for.

439
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:28,314
It's not a business venture, not
a theme park, but an entire world.

440
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:31,319
<i>We designed every inch of it.</i>

441
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,285
Every blade of grass.

442
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:46,000
In here, we were gods.

443
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:50,635
And you were merely our guests.

444
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:11,995
And how did that
work out for Arnold?

445
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:16,229
Sadly, he lost his perspective.

446
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:18,201
He went mad.

447
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:21,833
I haven't, as you well know.

448
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:25,033
I have always seen things

449
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:27,309
very clearly.

450
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:35,854
This is the table I
sat at with my parents.

451
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,750
This is the chair I sat in.

452
00:42:42,827 --> 00:42:44,989
We know everything
about our guests, don't we?

453
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:47,689
As we know everything
about our employees.

454
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:53,764
I do hope you will be
careful with Bernard.

455
00:42:56,841 --> 00:43:00,005
He has a sensitive disposition.

456
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:05,615
I beg your pardon, <i>señorita.</i>

457
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:16,388
<i>There have been many
of you over the years,</i>

458
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:17,620
<i>and we have always...</i>

459
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:20,698
Almost always, found
a way to make it work.

460
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:25,134
So, I will ask you nicely.

461
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:30,574
Please don't get in my way.

462
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,824
The board will agree with me.

463
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:50,289
They'll be sending
a representative.

464
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,829
But they already have. I
thought they would've told you.

465
00:43:56,767 --> 00:44:01,671
That won't be necessary, Manu.
Not anymore. You can join the others.

466
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:22,321
You can tell the board that my
narrative will be completed on time,

467
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:28,160
and it won't be a retrospective,
as I'm sure you have all feared.

468
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:38,500
I'm not the sentimental type.

469
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:52,250
Holden says this Slim's
got a whole gang with him.

470
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,959
So, I need you to stay here.

471
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,272
If you're outnumbered, the last thing
you need is somebody standing by.

472
00:44:58,296 --> 00:45:00,561
- I can help.
- No. No, no, no.

473
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,777
Um, I know it doesn't
make any sense to you,

474
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:05,633
but I can't get hurt
in there, but you can.

475
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,629
I would hate to see that happen.

476
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:11,333
Just stay here. Okay? Be safe.

477
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:24,989
- Aw. Did you get a goodbye kiss?
- Shut up.

478
00:45:25,156 --> 00:45:28,422
Seriously, if you don't bang
her by tomorrow, I'm calling dibs.

479
00:45:28,593 --> 00:45:31,085
Okay, listen up. It's gonna
be a bag of nails in there.

480
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:33,254
Slim and his boys
got us outnumbered.

481
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:37,858
On top of that, there's a family
runs this place. Good people.

482
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:41,148
We need to make sure that snake-hearted
son of a bitch doesn't try to...

483
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:43,437
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Risk, reward. We get it.

484
00:45:43,608 --> 00:45:46,168
Come on. Let's go
fuck these fuckers up.

485
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,013
The fuck is that? Huh?

486
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:55,915
- I look like a dog to you? Huh?
- No, sir.

487
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,919
Feed that to them.

488
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:04,122
Slap leather, cocksuckers.

489
00:46:04,629 --> 00:46:05,688
Oh, God!

490
00:46:32,056 --> 00:46:33,888
Did I fucking tell you, or what?

491
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:39,355
Ah.

492
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,815
Ooh.

493
00:47:08,793 --> 00:47:10,819
Upgrade. Nice.

494
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:17,861
Ain't normally the type to
complain, but this is just foolhardy.

495
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:19,867
Two men taking on Wyatt.

496
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:23,397
Keep talking, and I'm gonna
take the horse back, Lawrence.

497
00:47:23,741 --> 00:47:28,304
Wyatt's freaks just wiped out the
last group that went seeking him out.

498
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:31,811
And here we are
riding right after him.

499
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,584
I'm just trying to convince you

500
00:47:37,755 --> 00:47:41,089
not to get yourself, and
me as a bystander, killed.

501
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:44,495
I'm not gonna get myself killed.

502
00:47:45,296 --> 00:47:47,595
Don't think I didn't
notice that distinction.

503
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:11,720
Looks like Wyatt's men left
somebody behind after all.

504
00:48:14,592 --> 00:48:15,753
It's Teddy.

505
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,223
I should've guessed.

506
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:22,600
Please, put me out of my misery.

507
00:48:23,968 --> 00:48:25,561
I'm sorry, Teddy.

508
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:29,768
It looks like
misery's all you got.

509
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:35,341
<i>Let me out of this, God damn it!</i>

510
00:48:35,546 --> 00:48:37,310
That reward is
dead or alive, right?

511
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:39,480
Always best to
bring 'em in alive.

512
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,275
Can we at least gag him?

513
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:43,287
That's a fine idea.

514
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:44,815
Ooh.

515
00:48:48,793 --> 00:48:49,988
<i>Aw, come on.</i>

516
00:48:50,161 --> 00:48:52,761
Look, I know you're in it for the
money. You ain't no real lawman.

517
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:56,391
- Shut up, you.
- Look, my boss, El Lazo,

518
00:48:56,567 --> 00:49:00,971
he'll pay you twice what the marshals will
if you cut me loose and get me to Pariah.

519
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:03,334
- Listen to me, you lowdown piece of dirt.
- Hey...

520
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:04,839
These men won't...

521
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:10,347
- What the fuck?
<i>- Relax, man.</i>

522
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,440
You have no idea
how lucky we just got.

523
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,245
Lucky? You just
shot an innocent man!

524
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:18,446
No, he is a robot, just like
her, and just like Slim here,

525
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,148
except that Slim
works for El Lazo,

526
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:25,194
and El Lazo is our ticket
to the best ride in the park.

527
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:28,196
Your bullshit mission led
us right to an Easter egg.

528
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,270
You're not going to let him go.

529
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:35,201
Well, well. Look at you.

530
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:38,676
You're starting to grow on me,
farm girl. Now, out of the way.

531
00:49:40,244 --> 00:49:41,303
Whoa.

532
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:42,810
Don't you dare.

533
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:46,643
See? This is gonna be fun!
Now we're each gonna have one.

534
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,718
I won't fuck mine either.

535
00:49:48,886 --> 00:49:50,047
You're disgusting.

536
00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:51,484
Just an acquired taste.

537
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,255
You're gonna grow
to love me, I promise.

538
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:57,522
Come on. Hmm?

539
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,226
Come on.

540
00:50:01,966 --> 00:50:03,730
Go black hat with me.

541
00:50:04,602 --> 00:50:07,094
Come on. You got to,
you know, save the girl.

542
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:08,569
Now give me a little something.

543
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,765
What is your problem?
The second we get away

544
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:12,861
from the real world,
you turn into an evil prick.

545
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:14,844
Evil?

546
00:50:15,279 --> 00:50:16,907
It's a fucking game, Billy!

547
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:20,051
<i>- Don't call me Billy!
- Are you still trying to impress her?</i>

548
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:23,137
Because I guarantee she does not
give a shit about how you play this game.

549
00:50:23,287 --> 00:50:25,586
<i>- Do you, Dolores?</i>
- What's he talking about, William?

550
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,627
She will be just fine with
a trip down the dark side.

551
00:50:30,094 --> 00:50:31,687
And so will you.

552
00:50:35,299 --> 00:50:36,597
Trust me.

553
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,810
So, which way to Pariah?

554
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:50,137
Aw, you just let
me take it from here.

555
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:57,282
All right, time for
the floor show.

556
00:50:58,088 --> 00:51:00,455
Got some guests riding
with Hector this time.

557
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:23,040
Let's give them
something to shoot at.

558
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:25,479
Re-task a few of those soldiers.

559
00:51:27,151 --> 00:51:30,144
If you're riding into our town
under the company of armed men,

560
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:32,313
<i>you'll need to
state your business.</i>

561
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:34,219
Mayhem.

562
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,794
Well, hello there.
I want to talk.

563
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:23,202
Interesting way of
starting a conversation.

564
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,474
Oh, it's an
interesting kind of day.

565
00:52:35,853 --> 00:52:37,617
Now, my lovely friend,

566
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:41,058
what deal is it
you want to make?

567
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:43,691
You're here for
what's in the safe.

568
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:45,681
And how would you know that?

569
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:49,931
I can always tell when a man wants
something that's not on the menu.

570
00:52:51,602 --> 00:52:55,437
I'll give you the combination
in exchange for some answers.

571
00:52:55,606 --> 00:52:57,336
<i>You assume I have any answers.</i>

572
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:02,338
This world is madness.

573
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,040
I want to know about this.

574
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:09,396
I've got a couple families

575
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,180
in the homestead who
changed their itinerary.

576
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:12,950
They're headed into town.

577
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:16,753
<i>Should be there in 20 minutes
or so. Place is a bloodbath.</i>

578
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:21,592
Fine. Cut these guys off. Jam their
weapons and send in the cavalry.

579
00:53:29,907 --> 00:53:31,637
Oh, shit.

580
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:38,191
We'll give them a night in lockup,
then have one of the girls at the Mariposa

581
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,895
bring them a key
hidden in their breakfast.

582
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,485
If the guests are squared
away, let's wrap it up.

583
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:45,680
This is a shade.

584
00:53:47,124 --> 00:53:50,754
Sacred native lore.
They make figures of 'em.

585
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:54,695
Sixty.

586
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,737
And what does this shade do?

587
00:54:05,943 --> 00:54:07,104
You've seen this?

588
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:08,805
What is it?

589
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:11,415
<i>The man who walks
between worlds.</i>

590
00:54:12,116 --> 00:54:15,143
They were sent from
hell to oversee our world.

591
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:19,288
Forty-seven.

592
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:35,336
Is this the last thing
you required of me?

593
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:39,570
'Cause we need a little more time
than the constabulary will allow.

594
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:41,654
Sweetheart, if I took that
manner of interest in you,

595
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:43,909
you'd have no say in how
long we'd need whatsoever.

596
00:54:49,987 --> 00:54:51,478
I thought I was crazy,

597
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:56,290
but I got shot here.

598
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,521
- There's no wound.
- No.

599
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:01,858
But I was shot.

600
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:06,428
And this was standing over me.
And then it was as if it never happened.

601
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,763
I want you to cut
me right there.

602
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:31,388
I'm not in the habit of cutting
into defenseless women.

603
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:33,995
Some big, bad outlaw.

604
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,895
The Dreamwalker said there
were some who could see them.

605
00:55:39,236 --> 00:55:41,467
- That it's a blessing from God.
- A blessing?

606
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:44,005
To see the masters
who pull your strings.

607
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,239
They don't know what
they're talking about.

608
00:55:59,156 --> 00:56:03,594
You wanna die lying
down or up on your feet?

609
00:56:04,895 --> 00:56:05,895
Go to hell.

610
00:56:25,282 --> 00:56:26,443
Go on, then.

611
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:30,082
This would be the
first goddamn time

612
00:56:30,254 --> 00:56:32,254
I've had to ask a man to
put his hands on me twice.

613
00:56:57,948 --> 00:57:00,679
<i>Open up, Escaton, or we'll fire!</i>

614
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,353
What does it mean?

615
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:06,086
That I'm not crazy after all.

616
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,020
<i>Last chance, Escaton!</i>

617
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,360
<i>Come out or we're shooting!</i>

618
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,765
And that none of this matters.

619
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:32,675
English -SDH
