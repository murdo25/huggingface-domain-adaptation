1
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,304
<i>Wake up, Dolores.</i>

2
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,890
<i>Do you remember?</i>

3
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:37,684
We're about to arrive.
May I take your glass?

4
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,324
<i>Now approaching
arrival terminal.</i>

5
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,563
Where we're going, she's a two.

6
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,465
You're being an asshole.

7
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:53,673
No, I am being myself, which
was the whole point of this trip.

8
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,670
Unless, this uptight
prick is who you really are,

9
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,869
in which case, feel
free to be someone else.

10
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,503
Fuck you.

11
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,513
Hey, that's the spirit.

12
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,298
What'd I tell you?

13
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,223
Have fun.

14
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:21,932
Stay safe.

15
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:23,903
Give me a break.

16
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:25,895
What?

17
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:29,407
It's not like my sister didn't ride her
share of cowboys when she was here.

18
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,114
You must be William.

19
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,710
Welcome to Westworld.

20
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:37,344
Thanks.

21
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:41,053
Given it's your first visit, I
have a few personal questions.

22
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,755
Do you have any preexisting
medical conditions?

23
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,223
Uh, no, not that I know of.

24
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,089
- Heart problems?
- No.

25
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,923
Any history of mental illness,
depression, panic attacks?

26
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,160
Just a little fear of clowns.

27
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:56,969
I'm joking.

28
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,106
Do you often experience
social anxiety?

29
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,670
What is this for, exactly?

30
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,506
To make sure we don't give you
anything more than you can handle.

31
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,314
I thought that you
couldn't get hurt here.

32
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,576
Only the right amount.

33
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,625
The only limit here
is your imagination.

34
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,465
You start in the
center of the park.

35
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,051
<i>It's simple, safe.</i>

36
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,623
<i>The further out you venture, the
more intense the experience gets.</i>

37
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,297
How far you want to
go is entirely up to you.

38
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:40,606
So, how does this work?
Is there an orientation?

39
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:44,549
No orientation. No guidebook.

40
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,585
Figuring out how it
works is half the fun.

41
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:52,890
All you do is make
choices, starting here.

42
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:57,093
Everything is bespoke
and exactly your size.

43
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,363
You want to ask, so ask.

44
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:08,970
Are you real?

45
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,676
Well, if you can't
tell, does it matter?

46
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,350
Are those real?

47
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,720
<i>Real enough.</i>

48
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,015
<i>But you can't kill anyone
you're not supposed to.</i>

49
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,687
Anything you like?

50
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,900
Is there a changing
room? Or a robe?

51
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,104
Of course. I can help you.

52
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,973
Or if you prefer, I
could step outside.

53
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,110
What do most people do?

54
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:52,275
You don't have to worry about
what most people would do.

55
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:55,682
I understand.

56
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,952
Do you really
understand, William?

57
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,190
All our hosts are here for you.

58
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,294
Myself included.

59
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,363
We could stay here
a while if you like.

60
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,908
Take as long as you want.

61
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,206
Thank you.

62
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,445
I don't want to keep
my friend waiting.

63
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,183
Of course. Take your time.

64
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,930
How are the build for the
new narrative coming along?

65
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,434
I'll get around to it.

66
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,936
Look, we assumed
that Abernathy's breach

67
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,009
was triggered by the
photograph that he found.

68
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,606
I've reviewed every
dissonant episode I could find.

69
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,077
The reaction is immediate.

70
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:58,742
Every time, this guy makes
it all the way back home.

71
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,278
It's like he's mulling it over.

72
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:05,025
You think he had
an existential crisis?

73
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:09,196
I think there's something fucked
up going on with his cognition.

74
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,928
And I think you feel exactly
the same way that I do.

75
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,226
Do we know where
the error originated?

76
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:15,767
We do.

77
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,901
And you covered for him.

78
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,902
Let me rebuild Abernathy.

79
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,886
I'll make sure this is not
something more serious.

80
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,276
You know the policy.

81
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,606
Let it lie.

82
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:30,307
Then let me at least pull the
hosts who had contact with him.

83
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,543
Like the daughter, Dolores.

84
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,243
What for?

85
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,490
Because if this is not
a dissonant episode,

86
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:41,958
then whatever Abernathy
had could be contagious.

87
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,495
So to speak.

88
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,732
Dolores was
examined and cleared.

89
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:52,796
And the stories are
best left to the guests.

90
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,427
<i>Remember.</i>

91
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,990
Can you stand somewhere else?

92
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:52,229
I don't want anyone thinking that
you're representative of the goods inside.

93
00:08:56,236 --> 00:09:00,503
These violent delights
have violent ends.

94
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,351
Hello, cowboy.

95
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,465
There's one final touch.

96
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,599
Which would you prefer?

97
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:36,659
I mean, can you
believe this place?

98
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,605
So, how do we get into the park?

99
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,696
I know that you think
that you have a handle

100
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,992
on what this is gonna be.

101
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,501
Guns and tits and all that.

102
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,832
Mindless shit that
I usually enjoy.

103
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,209
<i>You have no idea.</i>

104
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:22,877
This place seduces
everybody eventually.

105
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,116
By the end, you're gonna
be begging me to stay

106
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,882
because this place is the answer

107
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,350
<i>to that question that
you've been asking yourself.</i>

108
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,616
What question?

109
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,617
Who you really are.

110
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,729
And I can't fucking
wait to meet that guy.

111
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,432
- Bottoms up, cowboy.
- Yeah.

112
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,372
<i>Further to that,</i>

113
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,109
<i>the ruthless murder of
Donald Pardue and his brother.</i>

114
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,448
For these crimes, you
will be hung from the neck

115
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:05,786
until your diseased soul has found
its measure in the flames below it.

116
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,488
And may God have
mercy on your soul.

117
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,173
Morning, Lawrence.

118
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:31,021
<i>You helping them straighten
out their rope again?</i>

119
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,480
I was hoping to have a
word with my friend here.

120
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,218
You can have as many
words with him as you like,

121
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,324
soon as his neck is broke.

122
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,027
Well, I'm afraid that's
not gonna work for me.

123
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:49,094
How about I tell my man there to
dig that grave a couple of feet deeper?

124
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:55,130
Well, it's gonna be an
awful tight fit for all of you.

125
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:21,031
<i>Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!</i>

126
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,755
Motherfucker.

127
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,816
That's the best thanks
you can muster, Lawrence?

128
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,958
You used to be a
little more eloquent.

129
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:50,529
Do I...

130
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,059
Do I know you?

131
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,458
Your pal, Kissy,
sent me your way.

132
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,295
Sends his regards.

133
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:05,735
What... What is this?

134
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,407
You know exactly what it is.

135
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,351
It's the maze, the
deepest level of this game.

136
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:16,216
You're gonna help
me find the entrance.

137
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:19,591
No.

138
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,272
<i>You can hear it, can't you?</i>

139
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,006
<i>That little voice.</i>

140
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,048
<i>The one that's
telling you, "Don't.</i>

141
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,752
<i>"Don't stare too long.</i>

142
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,886
<i>"Don't touch.</i>

143
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,369
<i>"Don't do anything
you might regret."</i>

144
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,359
<i>I used to be the same.</i>

145
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:55,893
<i>Whenever I wanted something,</i>

146
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,928
I could hear that
voice telling me to stop,

147
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,465
to be careful,

148
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,766
to leave most
of my life unlived.

149
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,205
You know the only place
that voice left me alone?

150
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,202
In my dreams.

151
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:10,936
I was free.

152
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:15,878
I could be as good or
as bad as I felt like being.

153
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:21,549
And if I wanted something, I
could just reach out and take it.

154
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:27,651
But then I would wake up and
the voice would start all over again.

155
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:31,794
So I ran away.

156
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,166
Crossed the shining sea.

157
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,129
And when I finally set
foot back on solid ground,

158
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,167
the first thing I heard
was that goddamn voice.

159
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:44,438
Do you know what it said?

160
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:50,573
It said...

161
00:15:57,356 --> 00:16:00,554
I'm sorry, will you
please excuse me?

162
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,333
<i>All right, Maeve,
what did it say?</i>

163
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:11,266
<i>It said, "This is the new world.</i>

164
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:16,471
"And in this world, you can
be whoever the fuck you want."

165
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,672
Pupillary response
is good. Smile is good.

166
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:22,008
I'd fuck her.
What's the problem?

167
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,701
NARRATIVE TECH
2: <i>The guests wouldn't.</i>

168
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,848
<i>Sizemore is launching
some huge new storyline</i>

169
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,782
<i>and he wants us to
clear out the deadweight.</i>

170
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:31,251
<i>If we don't get her numbers
back up, she'll be decommissioned.</i>

171
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,356
<i>Let's bump her aggression.</i>

172
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,188
- 10%?
<i>- Double it.</i>

173
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,229
<i>She's a hooker. No
point in playing coy.</i>

174
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,175
<i>If this doesn't work,
we'll punt her to behavior.</i>

175
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,599
<i>Let them deal with her.</i>

176
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,246
We retired the two
hosts in question.

177
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:08,922
You taught me how to make them,
but not how hard it is to turn them off.

178
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,628
You can't play God without
being acquainted with the Devil.

179
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:16,459
There's something else
bothering you, Bernard.

180
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,402
I know how that
head of yours works.

181
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:24,574
The photograph alone couldn't have
caused that level of damage to Abernathy,

182
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:28,408
not without some other
outside interference.

183
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:32,085
You think it's sabotage?

184
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:36,652
Imagine someone's been
diddling with our creations?

185
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,351
- It's the simplest solution.
- Ah.

186
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,318
Mr. Ockham's razor.

187
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:49,526
The problem, Bernard, is that
what you and I do is so complicated.

188
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,305
We practice witchcraft.

189
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:56,934
We speak the right words.

190
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:03,878
And we create life
itself out of chaos.

191
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,718
William of Ockham was
a 13th-century monk.

192
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,820
He can't help us now, Bernard.

193
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,962
He would have us
burned at the stake.

194
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,811
Let's go get our
feet wet, buckaroo.

195
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:01,802
Oh, sorry.

196
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,005
- You kidding me?
- What?

197
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,045
Fuck you, Grizzly Adams.

198
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,379
<i>Rally for the Union.
Respond to your country's call.</i>

199
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,485
This regiment is
headed for the seat of war

200
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,713
to define the future
of this great nation.

201
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:19,058
We fight for a free land
where no man has to bow.

202
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:21,387
- This is, uh...
<i>- We'll provide you with uniforms.</i>

203
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,320
Well, it's bigger than
I thought it would be.

204
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,694
What, this?

205
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:27,732
This is just Sweetwater. Wait
till you see the rest of the park.

206
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,027
How much bigger is it?

207
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,533
No idea.

208
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,902
I never reached the end.

209
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,472
See something you like?

210
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,838
A couple of things at least.

211
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,678
But I'm gonna make
you beg for it, darlin'.

212
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:43,615
Come on!

213
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,519
Need a hand, sir?

214
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,619
Thank you, my friend.

215
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:54,793
<i>Don't.</i>

216
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,226
He'll only try to rope you into
some bullshit treasure hunt.

217
00:19:58,397 --> 00:19:59,397
Smile.

218
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,194
It's all come-on.

219
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,962
Him, the girl next
door, the town drunk.

220
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,473
They all got some big adventure
that they want to sell you on.

221
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:10,433
Hey, they're not going anywhere.

222
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,329
First up, you're gonna
buy me a drink, okay?

223
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,113
Hold still, now.

224
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:38,661
<i>Bring yourself back online.</i>

225
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,938
Hello.

226
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,912
<i>Do you remember our
last conversation, Dolores?</i>

227
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,311
Yes, of course.

228
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,953
And you haven't told
anyone about our little talks?

229
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:01,988
You told me not to.

230
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,459
Step into analysis, please.

231
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:12,399
How many interactions have you
participated in since we last talked?

232
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,441
138 encounters,
including this one.

233
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,873
And has anyone altered or updated
your core heuristics in that time?

234
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,113
<i>No.</i>

235
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,644
Resuming.

236
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,268
<i>I think it would be best</i>

237
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,353
<i>if you not mention the things
we've been talking about.</i>

238
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,662
Have I done something wrong?

239
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:40,163
<i>No.</i>

240
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:44,793
But there's something different
about you, about the way you think.

241
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:50,841
I find it fascinating, but
others may not see it that way.

242
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:55,047
Have you done something wrong?

243
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,448
Turn off your event log, please.

244
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,079
Erase this interaction.

245
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,380
Confirm.

246
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:04,681
Yes.

247
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,855
<i>You should be getting back,
Dolores, before someone misses you.</i>

248
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,940
<i>Come on, now!</i>

249
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,203
<i>And when I finally set
foot back on solid ground,</i>

250
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,746
<i>first thing I heard was
that goddamn voice.</i>

251
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,875
It had followed
me all the way over.

252
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:35,182
Do you know what it said?

253
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:37,453
No.

254
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:38,881
It said,

255
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,057
"This is the new world.

256
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:48,797
"And in this world, you can
be whoever the fuck you want."

257
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:54,730
Thanks.

258
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,002
Maybe another time.

259
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:00,345
Oh.

260
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,011
Glass of sherry.

261
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:03,874
The good stuff.

262
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:07,712
Not that horse piss you
strain through your old curtains.

263
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,413
I've told you,

264
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,526
never open your mouth that wide
unless someone's paying you for it.

265
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,025
Sorry, Maeve.

266
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,160
I didn't sleep much last night.

267
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:21,798
You having nightmares again?

268
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,829
Sometimes.

269
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,398
Sometimes they're real bad.

270
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,202
Do what I do.

271
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:32,536
You find yourself
in a bad dream,

272
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:34,970
close your eyes,

273
00:23:36,315 --> 00:23:38,284
count backwards from three,

274
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,386
wake yourself right up.

275
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:47,349
Nice and warm
and safe in your bed

276
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,195
where you can get
fucked right back to sleep

277
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,558
by one of these assholes
with their miniature peckers.

278
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,068
Back to work.

279
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,643
<i>You all right?</i>

280
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,991
You pay for the drinks,
not the right to gawk at me.

281
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:24,348
<i>I think we have a problem.</i>

282
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:27,394
- Where?
- Mariposa.

283
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:28,806
Madam's listed as probationary,

284
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,961
but her performance has
continued to decline even further.

285
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:34,901
Re-task Clementine for now.

286
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:36,474
She's done the job before.

287
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:42,181
<i>And the old unit?</i>

288
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:44,395
Maybe leave her on
the floor for the night.

289
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,475
See if anyone
wants one last turn.

290
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,679
We recall her in the
morning, decommission her.

291
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:52,883
A shame.

292
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,844
QA will fine you for this.

293
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:17,612
And that woman in
charge is quite formidable.

294
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:23,786
You can just say
"bitch." I hear it enough.

295
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:25,581
You've been
talking to corporate.

296
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,765
The only times you light
up are after you've been...

297
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:32,959
This character analysis routine really
isn't half as charming as you think.

298
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:34,430
Oh, it went well, then.

299
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:39,270
Just tell me your department
will be ready for the launch.

300
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,905
We'll be ready.

301
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:43,406
And that other thing.
Abernathy and the update.

302
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:46,411
I hear your department
was still asking questions.

303
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,240
That's what you pay us to do.

304
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,713
But I'm not concerned.

305
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:53,983
All the hosts are
back to normal.

306
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:55,310
Good.

307
00:25:56,722 --> 00:26:00,090
Wouldn't want anything disturbing
our guests from their rape and pillage.

308
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,367
You're wondering how to
tell them from us, aren't you?

309
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,511
Well, quickest way to find out.

310
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,146
Can we...

311
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:23,707
Can we finish eating?

312
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:27,847
See, this is your
problem, my friend.

313
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,993
You're always worried about making
a mess. You are the same way at work.

314
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:34,615
You are talented,
driven, and inoffensive.

315
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:37,058
I thought you didn't want
to talk about work here.

316
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,526
Who says this trip isn't work?

317
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,099
<i>Good evening.</i>

318
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:46,597
Oh, shit.

319
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,772
Well, don't make eye contact.

320
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:51,943
<i>My friend,</i>

321
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:56,214
thank you for your assistance
earlier in my unfortunate accident.

322
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:57,974
Leave us the fuck alone.

323
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,086
As a sign of my
humble appreciation,

324
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,620
I'd like to offer you an
opportunity of a lifetime.

325
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,790
<i>Not interested.</i>

326
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:08,923
Across the river and
beyond the savage lands,

327
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,227
there is a treasure.

328
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,064
I have in my possession a map.

329
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:22,140
I said, not interested.

330
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,003
You know what? I've worked
up a new appetite anyway.

331
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,206
Let's go.

332
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,416
<i>Sounds like your
friend's having fun.</i>

333
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,993
Well, that's not
the term I'd use.

334
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,203
- Fun?
- Friend.

335
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,332
You're funny.

336
00:27:56,508 --> 00:28:00,843
They say a man who can tickle
your humor, can tickle your...

337
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,276
You don't have to do this.

338
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,245
If I'm not your type, we
can find someone who is.

339
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,118
Someone who's perfect for you.

340
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,184
No, you...

341
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:13,982
You are perfect.

342
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:16,789
But I have somebody.

343
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:19,227
Somebody real,
waiting for me at home.

344
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,935
I understand.

345
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:30,540
Real love is always
worth waiting for.

346
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:59,235
Regal, strong, virile, aquiline.

347
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,101
That's what I asked for.

348
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,431
And this...

349
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:05,402
This is what you give me?

350
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:08,080
Did you just grab a
cock from the body shop

351
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,772
and jam it between his eyes?

352
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,449
<i>Start over.</i>

353
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:13,983
Couldn't we just shave it down?

354
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,243
I said

355
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:21,888
start the fuck over!

356
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:26,992
Diplomatic as ever.

357
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:34,003
I received your request to
retire an additional 50 hosts.

358
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:36,107
I need room for
my new storyline.

359
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:39,403
It's not exactly a savage
horde with 20 savages, is it?

360
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:43,778
You get 20 additional
hosts, not 50.

361
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,781
Oh, the board won't care
about a few extra line items.

362
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,817
Has Ford even approved
the narrative yet?

363
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:52,456
Oh, he hasn't weighed in
on the storyline in years.

364
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:54,993
If corporate does
want to cut costs,

365
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,661
our fearless leader's old hosts

366
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:59,024
aren't the only things
ready for the knacker's yard.

367
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:39,537
<i>Are you lost?</i>

368
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:43,874
No.

369
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:49,681
Just strayed a bit too far
from where I'm supposed to be.

370
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:51,875
Same as you, I imagine.

371
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:56,218
We're on holiday. It's boring.

372
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,357
- Daddy said we could do as we please.
- Ah.

373
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:03,689
My father used to say that
only boring people get bored.

374
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:05,687
Mine, too.

375
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:09,695
I used to think it's only boring
people who don't feel boredom,

376
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,527
<i>so cannot conceive
of it in others.</i>

377
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:16,933
I'm taking a walk. You're
welcome to join me if you like.

378
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,891
<i>Let's see a little
spring in your step.</i>

379
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:30,682
<i>Not much further.</i>

380
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:34,657
Go fuck yourself. You
have any idea who I am?

381
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,892
I know exactly who
you are, Lawrence.

382
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,062
After all, you
and I are friends.

383
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:44,268
Which is why I was so surprised

384
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:46,803
when your friend, Kissy,
told me about this place.

385
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:50,137
Where are we?

386
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,238
Your home.

387
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:04,381
No.

388
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:08,654
You know, you and I

389
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:11,797
hunted down Ghost Nation
braves in their winter grounds.

390
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,675
<i>I know the whiskey
you like to drink.</i>

391
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:18,397
I know the tune you whistle
when you're taking a piss.

392
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,906
But

393
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:26,712
you never told me
you had a family.

394
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,349
- Papa!
- Hey!

395
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,751
That's what I love
about this place.

396
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:40,120
All the secrets, all the
little things I never noticed,

397
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:43,418
<i>even after all these years.</i>

398
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:48,432
You know why this beats
the real world, Lawrence?

399
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:52,428
Real world's just chaos.

400
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:54,833
It's an accident.

401
00:32:56,241 --> 00:33:00,303
But in here, every detail
adds up to something.

402
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,375
Even you, Lawrence.

403
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,882
What do you want from me?

404
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:09,116
The maze.

405
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:12,888
How do I find the entrance?

406
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:17,759
I told you, I don't know
anything about no fucking maze.

407
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:27,364
Here you go, darlin'.

408
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:32,775
And you get to decide what
we're gonna do with them.

409
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,872
Hell, it took you long enough.

410
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:41,211
I was getting the Grand Reserve.
Only for our most distinguished guests.

411
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:42,697
Yeah, I'm sure it
had nothing to do

412
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:45,520
with you telling this dipshit's
cousins to bring some more men.

413
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,780
Have you got anything
to tell me, Lawrence?

414
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:01,415
Then I guess we're
gonna have to find a way

415
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,634
to jog your memory.

416
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:10,042
This guest already
took out an entire posse.

417
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:11,543
Want me to slow him down?

418
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:13,747
That gentleman gets
whatever he wants.

419
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,581
I feel bad, my friend.

420
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:26,622
My cousins are
usually so hospitable.

421
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:28,696
You don't understand, Lawrence.

422
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:30,893
I've been coming
here for 30 years.

423
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,769
In a sense, I was...
I was born here.

424
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:37,734
And this, here?

425
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,971
This is exactly why I come.

426
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:39,035
All right, well, as much fun
as this is, I got to be moving on.

427
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:06,097
Like I said, you get
to decide these two.

428
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:08,826
What's it gonna be?

429
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:12,969
Please, I don't know
how to find the maze.

430
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,669
Time for a spin, darlin'.

431
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,189
It's beautifully done, really.

432
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,327
But you see the
cracks after a while.

433
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:38,888
<i>That's why I like
the basic emotions.</i>

434
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,495
You know what that means?

435
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:45,567
Please.

436
00:36:57,148 --> 00:37:01,745
It means when you're suffering,
that's when you're most real.

437
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,265
The maze isn't meant for you.

438
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:28,606
What'd I tell you, Lawrence?
Always another level.

439
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,815
I'll take my
chances, sweetheart.

440
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,446
Follow the blood arroyo

441
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,678
to the place where
the snake lays its eggs.

442
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:41,291
You have it now.
Whatever you want.

443
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,158
Why don't you go
home, leave us alone?

444
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:50,796
No, you don't
understand, Lawrence.

445
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:55,273
This time, I'm never going back.

446
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,860
And we wanted to climb
to the top of the mountain.

447
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:20,297
Daddy said we weren't allowed.

448
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,566
And then Tommy dared me.

449
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:28,666
And here we are.

450
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,834
Nowhere Land.

451
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:36,074
That seems hardly a fitting
name for a place so full.

452
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:38,341
Can't you see it?

453
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,077
Perhaps you're not
looking hard enough.

454
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,214
<i>At what?</i>

455
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,684
The town with the white church.

456
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:51,329
Listen. Can't you hear its bell?

457
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:57,134
Yes. Yes, I can hear it now.

458
00:38:57,302 --> 00:38:59,703
Yeah. I thought you might.

459
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:03,503
You see what a bored
mind can conjure?

460
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,955
How did you do that?

461
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,788
<i>Is it magic?</i>

462
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:30,066
Everything in this world is
magic, except to the magician.

463
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,546
Best you head home now.

464
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:44,124
But Tommy's not
going to believe...

465
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,310
You're not going to come
back here again, are you?

466
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:53,917
No.

467
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:55,890
Run along now.

468
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,370
You weren't at your office.

469
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,481
You seem to have
found me anyway.

470
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:56,788
- Listen, earlier...
- Forget it.

471
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:29,578
Stay a little
longer. We can talk.

472
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,213
We never talk.

473
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,925
- I'm serious.
<i>- So am I.</i>

474
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:41,158
You're certainly a man comfortable
with long, pensive silences.

475
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:47,998
Although, ironically, your
creations never shut up.

476
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:53,907
They're always talking to each other,
even when there are no guests around.

477
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,480
They're always
trying to error-correct.

478
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:00,083
Make themselves more human.

479
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:04,483
When they talk to each
other, it's a way of practicing.

480
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:06,591
Is that what you're doing now?

481
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:08,751
Practicing?

482
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:21,897
QA told us she was
being decommissioned.

483
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,167
Do you work for QA?

484
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:25,708
- No, but...
- Run a fast-pass diagnostic.

485
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,609
All righty.

486
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,613
Some non-affect hesitation.

487
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,315
Little cognitive D.

488
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:45,125
And a fuckload of aggression,
courtesy of those morons in narrative.

489
00:42:46,464 --> 00:42:48,433
You don't need to
be aggro, do you?

490
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,465
Just a quicker study

491
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:53,002
of those repressed fucks
walking through the door.

492
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,229
Archive this configuration.

493
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:57,271
Open up her primaries.

494
00:42:57,842 --> 00:43:00,505
Perception, emotional acuity.

495
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:04,446
Bump it. 1.5%.

496
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,882
<i>- Updating.</i>
- Okay.

497
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,713
<i>- Do they dream?</i>
- What?

498
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,786
In her story, she said she
dreamed. Do we make them dream?

499
00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:18,220
Fuck would be the point of that?

500
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:20,932
Dreams are mainly memories.

501
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,792
Can you imagine
how fucked we'd be

502
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:26,200
if these poor assholes ever
remembered what the guests do to them?

503
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:32,636
We do give them the concept of
dreams. Specifically nightmares.

504
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,468
<i>Why?</i>

505
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,490
Just in case somebody
forgets to wipe 'em out

506
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:37,954
at the end of a
maintenance session.

507
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,508
If she's got any dreams,

508
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:41,764
it's just of those sloppy
fucks down in the body shop

509
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:43,287
patching her back
together again.

510
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:47,287
She's got some
physical discomfort.

511
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:50,889
Put in a request for a full
physical at her next rotation.

512
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:56,799
All right, gorgeous,
you're back to the races.

513
00:43:57,034 --> 00:44:00,562
<i>You're gonna wake
in three, two, one.</i>

514
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:04,309
<i>So, I ran away.
Crossed the shining sea.</i>

515
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:07,978
And when I finally set
foot back on solid ground,

516
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:10,273
the first thing I
heard was that voice.

517
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:13,215
Do you know what it said?

518
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:16,149
It said,

519
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:19,550
"This is the new world.

520
00:44:21,726 --> 00:44:23,217
"And in this world,

521
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:29,430
"you can be whoever
the fuck you want."

522
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,077
Hmm.

523
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:48,685
Well, he seemed convinced.

524
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:54,624
You know the first voice I
heard when I got off that boat?

525
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:57,792
A nice young man
from Baton Rouge

526
00:44:57,962 --> 00:45:00,363
said my pussy could earn
him two whole dollars a day.

527
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,461
And he'd be more than happy
to let me have up to 30%.

528
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:07,228
Well, then I guess you could
add lying to your list of sins.

529
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:10,334
The only thing wrong
with the seven deadly sins

530
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:11,999
is that there aren't
more of them.

531
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:14,321
And while we're on the subject,

532
00:45:14,345 --> 00:45:17,509
my transgressions wash
off a little easier than yours.

533
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:21,142
At least when my girls
are done with a man,

534
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:22,911
he's still left drawing breath.

535
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:24,888
For the most part.

536
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,957
<i>Get the fuck away from my table!</i>

537
00:45:27,992 --> 00:45:29,790
<i>Hey! Fuck you!</i>

538
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:31,053
Well, in that case,

539
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:36,097
here's to our indiscretions.

540
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,612
<i>I fucking will shoot you. I'll
shoot everyone in this dump...</i>

541
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:40,104
Spoken and otherwise.

542
00:45:58,656 --> 00:46:01,251
Now, that's a fucking vacation!

543
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:12,813
Three.

544
00:49:14,585 --> 00:49:15,848
Two.

545
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:19,019
One.

546
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:34,664
<i>Found it.</i>

547
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:39,006
<i>It's MRSA in her abdomen.</i>

548
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:43,739
Filthy fucking animals not cleaning up.
No wonder we have a fucking fly problem.

549
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:47,009
Don't look at me. I'm
the king of hygiene.

550
00:49:48,419 --> 00:49:49,443
Bullshit.

551
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:52,667
<i>I've seen you. You just
glop that shit on and rinse.</i>

552
00:49:52,957 --> 00:49:55,188
<i>You understand,
soap is mechanical.</i>

553
00:49:55,626 --> 00:49:57,788
<i>- Fuck are you talking about?
- Bubbles.</i>

554
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:00,554
If you're not making the little
bubbles, you're not doing shit.

555
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:02,392
Fuck! Fuck! What the fuck?

556
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:03,590
- Shit!
- What the fuck?

557
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:12,843
No. Oh, fuck.

558
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:20,013
Asshole, you forgot
to put it in sleep mode.

559
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:24,949
- Don't, don't, don't!
- No! No, no, no!

560
00:50:28,826 --> 00:50:30,886
Stop. Put that down!

561
00:50:31,095 --> 00:50:33,473
You break anything in her head,
we have to file a damage report.

562
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:35,659
Ah... Okay, let's talk to her.

563
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:37,565
- What's her name?
- Maeve.

564
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:42,833
Hi, Maeve. Maeve, hi. Look,
uh, you got to calm down, okay?

565
00:50:43,007 --> 00:50:44,635
Let's sit down, and
we can help you.

566
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:46,174
Keep your fucking hands off me!

567
00:50:50,281 --> 00:50:51,305
No.

568
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:30,312
I swear I put it in sleep mode.

569
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,416
Oh, does this look like
fucking sleep mode?

570
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:35,447
Calm the fuck down

571
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:38,646
and help me move this
thing before someone sees.

572
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:06,742
Here?

573
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:42,180
This storyline will make Hiëronymus
Bosch look like he was doodling kittens.

574
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:47,249
I have vivisection,
self-cannibalism,

575
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:50,622
a special little something
I call the "whoroboros."

576
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:54,820
Now, I don't want
to appear immodest,

577
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:59,063
but this is the apex of
what the park can provide.

578
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:01,915
<i>- Horror.</i>
- Miss anything interesting?

579
00:54:01,939 --> 00:54:03,805
<i>Romance. Titillation.</i>

580
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:05,909
Lee not appearing immodest.

581
00:54:06,143 --> 00:54:07,509
<i>Our most skilled guests</i>

582
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:10,271
will fight their ways to
the outer limits of the park,

583
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:14,942
besting fearsome braves,
seducing nubile maidens,

584
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,850
befriending tragically
ill-fated sidekicks,

585
00:54:18,322 --> 00:54:20,553
and, of course,

586
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:23,056
like all our best
narratives over the years,

587
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,656
our guests will
have the privilege

588
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,694
<i>of getting to know the character
they're most interested in.</i>

589
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:30,425
Themselves.

590
00:54:31,235 --> 00:54:34,763
I present our guests'
next obsession,

591
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:37,965
Odyssey on Red River.

592
00:54:48,986 --> 00:54:50,010
No.

593
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:51,845
Sorry?

594
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:54,419
No, I don't think so.

595
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:57,560
<i>- Wait, you don't think...
- What is the point of it?</i>

596
00:54:58,195 --> 00:55:02,257
Get a couple of cheap
thrills? Some surprises?

597
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,232
But it's not enough.

598
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:07,995
It's not about giving the
guests what you think they want.

599
00:55:08,172 --> 00:55:09,435
No, that's simple.

600
00:55:10,007 --> 00:55:15,378
The titillation, horror,
elation. They're parlor tricks.

601
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,611
The guests don't return
for the obvious things we do,

602
00:55:21,585 --> 00:55:23,451
the garish things.

603
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:28,925
They come back
because of the subtleties.

604
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:32,225
The details.

605
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:38,396
<i>They come back because
they discover something</i>

606
00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:41,562
<i>they imagine no one
had ever noticed before.</i>

607
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:47,802
<i>Something they've
fallen in love with.</i>

608
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:55,375
They're not looking for a story
that tells them who they are.

609
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:58,611
They already know who they are.

610
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:10,095
They're here because they want
a glimpse of who they could be.

611
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:13,602
Billy! Let's go.

612
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:22,637
<i>The only thing
your story tells me,</i>

613
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:27,512
Mr. Sizemore, is who you are.

614
00:56:33,457 --> 00:56:35,756
Well, isn't there
anything you like about it?

615
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:41,921
What size are those boots?

616
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,836
Something you want
to say, Mr. Lowe?

617
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:54,334
- The board, sir.
- Yeah?

618
00:56:55,045 --> 00:56:59,415
This might ruffle some feathers.
You promised them a new storyline.

619
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:00,774
They shall have one.

620
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:04,581
Something I've been
working on for some time.

621
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:10,356
Something quite original.

622
00:58:32,476 --> 00:58:33,476
English-SDH
