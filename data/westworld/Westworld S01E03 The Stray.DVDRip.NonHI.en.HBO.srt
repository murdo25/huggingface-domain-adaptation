1
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,378
<i>Good morning, Dolores.</i>

2
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,507
<i>Bring yourself back online.</i>

3
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,547
Hello.

4
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,713
Has anyone else interacted with you in
a diagnostic since our last conversation?

5
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,425
No. I've been cleaned and
serviced three times. No diagnostics.

6
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:11,262
And you haven't told
anyone of our conversations?

7
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,059
You told me not to.

8
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,396
Good.

9
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:22,474
I brought you a gift.

10
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,244
I used to read

11
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,016
this story to my son at night.

12
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,510
I thought you might enjoy it.

13
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,353
Try...

14
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:42,956
Try...

15
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,158
This passage.

16
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:53,466
"Dear, dear!

17
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,101
"How queer everything is today!

18
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,876
"And yesterday things
went on just as usual.

19
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,974
"I wonder if I've been
changed in the night?"

20
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,112
Does that passage make
you think of anything?

21
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,656
It's like the other
books we've read.

22
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,219
How so?

23
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,722
It's about change.

24
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,864
It seems to be a common theme.

25
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:22,927
I guess people like to read about
the things that they want the most

26
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,095
and experience the least.

27
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,142
Your son.

28
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,412
Where is he now?

29
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:37,842
Nowhere that you would
understand, Dolores.

30
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,052
Perhaps that's why I enjoy
our conversations so much.

31
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,185
Analysis.

32
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,588
Why did you ask me about my son?

33
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,781
We have been talking
for some duration

34
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,831
and I haven't asked
you a personal question.

35
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,860
<i>Personal questions are
an ingratiating scheme.</i>

36
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:57,835
I see.

37
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,605
Continue, Dolores.

38
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,881
"Was I the same when
I got up this morning?

39
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:11,414
<i>"I almost think I can remember
feeling a little different.</i>

40
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,346
<i>"But if I'm not the same,</i>

41
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,613
"the next question is...

42
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,621
"Who in the world am I?"

43
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,845
<i>Do you remember?</i>

44
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,750
Why don't we reacquaint
ourselves, Dolores?

45
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,850
Start at the beginning.

46
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,499
Ready?

47
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,697
Thank you so much.

48
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,400
Morning, cowboy.

49
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,877
<i>Move it! Let's
go! Get out there.</i>

50
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:28,967
Stand right there.

51
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:32,358
<i>Shit.</i>

52
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:36,655
You really ought to talk to
someone about your poster, Horace.

53
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,992
That likeness is
a crime in itself.

54
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,404
<i>I'm gonna tend to my nag.</i>

55
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,034
You deal with him.

56
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:47,935
Ready my pay.

57
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,813
Don't no man shoot or
I'll send her to unction.

58
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:41,159
Any of you don't believe it are
welcome to read my biography there.

59
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,331
Let's go.

60
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,309
Oh, I bet you're juicy
as a freshwater clam.

61
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:27,467
Are you okay?

62
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,743
Nice shot, <i>amigo.</i>

63
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,716
You got grit.

64
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,111
Hey, I'm riding out tonight.

65
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,525
Looking for desperados.

66
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,558
Could cut you in,
if you're amenable.

67
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,527
Someone get the minister down
here for what's left of the deputy.

68
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,901
Sure I can't tempt you inside?

69
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,462
Just to express my gratitude?

70
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,591
Holy shit.

71
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,398
You popped your cherry.

72
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,472
I thought you said
we couldn't get shot.

73
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,607
We can't get killed.

74
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,817
Wouldn't be much of a
game if they can't shoot back.

75
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,411
How do you feel? Alive?

76
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,448
Little tight in the pants?

77
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,414
She was terrified.

78
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:50,488
That's why they exist,
man. So you get to feel this.

79
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,789
Come on, let's go put some
memories in that spank bank.

80
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,040
Trust me, you will thank me

81
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,426
after you've been married
to my sister for a year.

82
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,260
Actually, I have
something different in mind.

83
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:01,928
<i>What?</i>

84
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,232
<i>That?</i>

85
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:09,266
You've been preaching nonstop
about all the narratives in the park.

86
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,901
But all you've done since we've
arrived is fuck and drink, so...

87
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,071
I'm waiting for the good stuff.

88
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:18,741
This bounty is JV shit.

89
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,515
Then stay here.

90
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,246
I want a little adventure.

91
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,696
I've been looking for you.

92
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,674
I got a late start this morning.

93
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,367
Didn't get much
sleep last night.

94
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:45,978
Forgive me if I'm
not sympathetic

95
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,615
to the fluctuations of
your sleep cycle, Mr. Lowe.

96
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:52,616
Ford taking over the narrative launch
at the eleventh hour has made the board

97
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,681
uneasy.

98
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,286
Just the board, uh?

99
00:10:56,456 --> 00:11:00,359
I specifically asked you about
whether Ford was going to be a problem,

100
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,553
and you assured me he wasn't.

101
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,527
Well, I can't tell you
what I don't know.

102
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:05,892
Well, here's what I know.

103
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:09,365
As of this morning, Ford's
carved out a huge swath of the park

104
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,129
for whatever storyline
he's cooking up

105
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:14,365
and thrown half of the
existing storylines into disarray.

106
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:18,504
- Is there anything I can do?
- You tell me.

107
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,744
I asked you point-blank if the
problem with the update was resolved.

108
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:23,982
It is.

109
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,847
Then why are your people
still pulling hosts for follow-up?

110
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,387
Get your house
in order, Bernard.

111
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:34,884
And if there is a problem, I
strongly suggest you tell me.

112
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,558
Drop a new bookmark
and resume history.

113
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:46,764
Walter's intent on relieving the
milkmaid of her unmentionables.

114
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,374
Switch to analysis.

115
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,315
You didn't report the incident?

116
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,845
The unit self-corrected
within the acceptable window.

117
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,176
Right. Then he self-corrected a
fucking milk bottle into your skull.

118
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,342
It's amazing how
resilient the hosts are.

119
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,959
You were supposed to have
purged his memory on the last cycle.

120
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,423
I will. But Rebus here was the
last host to interact with Walter.

121
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,254
- Look at this.
<i>- Any for you?</i>

122
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,429
<i>Who said that?</i>

123
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,554
<i>Who's saying that?</i>

124
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,757
<i>Don't you talk to me that way.</i>

125
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,461
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

126
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,399
Do you see that?

127
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,868
He's talking to someone.

128
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,443
<i>He carries on practically
an entire conversation.</i>

129
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,080
<i>I need more milk, Arnold.</i>

130
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,076
<i>Who's Arnold?</i>

131
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,943
They're designed to
play off aberrant behavior.

132
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,918
- That could explain the "conversations."
- Fine.

133
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,318
<i>Then explain this.</i>

134
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,957
He kills six hosts.

135
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,925
He lets the other three go.

136
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,468
<i>I pulled the narrative logs.</i>

137
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:52,105
All six of these hosts were
part of storylines, over the years,

138
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,571
in which they killed Walter.

139
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,806
<i>It's like he was
holding a grudge.</i>

140
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,925
It's a stray. QA needs
a tag team to go track it.

141
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,323
Go. Handle the stray.

142
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,842
Do something that's actually
in your job description.

143
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,691
<i>The last thing we need is Theresa
storming down here seeing this.</i>

144
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,832
I'll do a little more digging and
get our friend here back upstairs.

145
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,947
Lost another one, huh?

146
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:47,225
Tell me, is QA's surveillance
coverage really this spotty,

147
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,555
<i>or do you just like
the nature walks?</i>

148
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,128
Maybe it's the company.

149
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,046
You know, if you
wanted to play cowboy,

150
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,950
you could have just used
your employee discount.

151
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,508
The only thing stopping the
hosts from hacking us to pieces

152
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,234
is one line of your code.

153
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,037
No offense, but
I sleep with this.

154
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,681
I bet you do.

155
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,320
Morning, Samuel.

156
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:36,535
You and your dickless associate
proposing to engage me in a gun battle?

157
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,710
Well, I'd challenge you to a
fistfight, but the way I heard it,

158
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,248
you only like to tussle
with working women.

159
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,928
<i>Is he dead?</i>

160
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,295
Dead enough.

161
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:04,913
Why are we gonna
handcuff a dead man?

162
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,372
Don't want someone
walking off with him.

163
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,407
It's not a man anymore.
That's merchandise, $500 worth.

164
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:25,048
All right. Which of you derelicts
hitched a dead body outside my saloon?

165
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,749
My apologies, ma'am.

166
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,486
I figured it was preferable
to bringing him inside.

167
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,799
Here. For your troubles.

168
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,009
<i>Ah. You're new.</i>

169
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:52,914
Not much of a rind on you.

170
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,280
I'll give you a discount.

171
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,661
You mind waiting
on that drink a bit?

172
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,449
Don't mind me.

173
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:34,652
Just trying to look chivalrous.

174
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,187
You came back.

175
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,796
I told you I would.

176
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:51,840
You gonna tell me
where you been?

177
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,079
Just...

178
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,014
Away.

179
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,385
You know if I could stay
right here with you, I would.

180
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,219
What if I don't
want to stay here?

181
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:14,591
It's just sometimes I feel like
the world out there is calling me.

182
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,464
Whispering, "There's
something more."

183
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:23,937
You've traveled all over these parts.
Isn't there anywhere we could go?

184
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:31,516
There is a place I
heard about down south.

185
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,717
Where the mountains
meet the sea.

186
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:39,047
They say the water's so pure
there, it'll wash the past clean off you.

187
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,885
And you can start again.

188
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,461
I'd like to go there with you.

189
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,030
Well, someday I'll take you.

190
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:00,606
"Someday."

191
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:03,947
Is something wrong?

192
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,313
You said "someday."

193
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,790
Not today, or
tomorrow, or next week.

194
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:12,882
Just "someday."

195
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,705
"Someday" sounds a lot
like the thing people say

196
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,789
when they actually mean "never."

197
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:27,136
Let's not go "someday," Teddy.

198
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:30,999
Let's go now.

199
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,998
Before I met you, Dolores,
I was a different man.

200
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:59,672
And I got some reckoning to do
before I can deserve a woman like you.

201
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:04,006
But I'm close. I'm close
to making things right.

202
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,543
And someday soon,

203
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,175
we will have the life we've
both been dreaming of.

204
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,151
And I'd best get you home before
your dad starts loading that shotgun.

205
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,737
Father wouldn't let them
roam this close to dark.

206
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:46,881
Stay put, Dolores.

207
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,559
<i>"A coward dies a
thousand deaths,</i>

208
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:31,127
<i>"the valiant taste
of death but once."</i>

209
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,959
<i>Of course, Shakespeare never
met a man quite like you, Teddy.</i>

210
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,736
<i>You've died at
least 1,000 times.</i>

211
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,438
<i>And yet, it hasn't
dulled your courage.</i>

212
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,245
Tell me, is that all
you aspire to, Teddy?

213
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:49,608
There's a girl.

214
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,409
Dolores.

215
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:53,918
<i>Better than I deserve.</i>

216
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,152
But maybe, someday soon,

217
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,386
we'll have the life we've
both been dreaming of.

218
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:02,885
No.

219
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:04,694
You never will.

220
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:09,458
Your job is not to protect
Dolores, it's to keep her here.

221
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,467
To ensure that
the guests find her

222
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,607
if they want to best
the stalwart gunslinger

223
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,199
and have their
way with his girl.

224
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:22,972
Tell me, has it never occurred
to you to run off with her?

225
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:26,447
I got some reckoning to
do before I can be with her.

226
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,483
Ah, yes, your
mysterious backstory.

227
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,815
It's the reason for my visit.

228
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:35,390
Do you know why it
is a mystery, Teddy?

229
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:39,196
Because we never actually
bothered to give you one,

230
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:42,062
just a formless guilt
you will never atone for.

231
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:46,968
But perhaps it is time you
had a worthy story of origin.

232
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,974
Would you like that, Teddy?

233
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,474
A small part of
my new narrative?

234
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:55,014
A fiction, which
like all great stories,

235
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:57,176
is rooted in truth?

236
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,580
It starts in a time of war.

237
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:06,856
A world in flames.

238
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:12,154
With a villain called Wyatt.

239
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,759
"Wyatt"?

240
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,668
Who's Wyatt?

241
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,672
Do you remember now, Teddy?

242
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:29,075
Yeah, of course I
remember Wyatt.

243
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:35,385
You look upon the face of
true evil, you ain't liable to forget.

244
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,720
He claimed he could
hear the voice of God.

245
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,190
It started down near Escalante.

246
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,958
Army was sent to
put down the natives.

247
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,091
Bad business.

248
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:52,802
Wyatt was a sergeant, went
missing while out on some maneuvers.

249
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:55,438
Came back a few weeks later

250
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,611
with some pretty strange ideas.

251
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,561
I wasn't lying, was I?

252
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:23,599
Pretty as a picture and tight
as a tympani drum, I reckon.

253
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,571
Afternoon.

254
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,239
My friend here is new to town.

255
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:39,982
Figured the rancher's daughter
would be a nice way to kick things off.

256
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:43,020
Maybe take us all
for a little hayride.

257
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:46,956
I'm sorry.

258
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,390
I have to get home. My
father will be expecting me.

259
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:50,994
We won't be long.

260
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,064
<i>The lady doesn't
appear interested.</i>

261
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,439
Try it.

262
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,527
<i>You might get the draw
on me, you might not,</i>

263
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:05,542
<i>but I'd say your odds
ain't looking good.</i>

264
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,439
Told you I wanted
something easy.

265
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,132
<i>She ain't worth the lead.</i>

266
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,212
Let's head to Virgil's.

267
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,022
See if they'll stake us.

268
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:01,492
First, you gotta
learn how to stand.

269
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:16,415
Now, take a breath.

270
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,181
Hold it.

271
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,259
Now squeeze.

272
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,439
I can't.

273
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:49,405
Some hands weren't
meant to pull a trigger.

274
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:51,610
Perhaps it's for the best.

275
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:05,758
Teddy, we got another bounty.

276
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,271
I think this is a big one.

277
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,134
Man in question gunned down an
entire settlement out near Flat Rock.

278
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,429
Men, women and children.

279
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,437
<i>I think this may be the man you've
been looking for, for quite some time.</i>

280
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,636
A man named Wyatt.

281
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:21,640
Wyatt.

282
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:26,683
Who is he, Teddy?

283
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,286
<i>You'd be better asking
"what" than "who," ma'am.</i>

284
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,452
Wyatt's a pestilence.

285
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,624
Word is, Flood here's
the only man ever

286
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:37,422
come up against him
and lived to tell the tale.

287
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,199
Give me a moment, Sheriff.

288
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,336
You have to leave
again, don't you?

289
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,541
You know if I could stay
right here with you, I would.

290
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,345
Promise me you'll come back.

291
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:03,878
I promise.

292
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,763
I'm gonna come back for you,

293
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:22,500
someday soon.

294
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,720
I got a pit in my stomach
the size of a sow's tit.

295
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,494
Cook up that rabbit.

296
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,262
Get the wood.

297
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,229
I can't cook shit
without a fire.

298
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,167
Don't sell yourself short, Cookie.
You can cook shit in all conditions.

299
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:54,883
Now, see, I pitched them tents.

300
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:56,500
I ain't chopping any more wood.

301
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,908
You spend more time on
your back than a hooker in heat.

302
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,377
Now pick up that fucking
ax and go chop us...

303
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,452
So, after our stray
ran away from camp,

304
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,249
looks like these guys
got caught in a loop.

305
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:16,189
They were due in town for the
cattle drive over two days ago.

306
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,390
Host who went missing
is the woodcutter.

307
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:22,045
Looks like the rest of them got
stuck here, waiting for supper.

308
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:25,147
You guys can't program more than
one of these idiots to make a fire?

309
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,570
We could, but thanks to a
new policy from your boss,

310
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,232
only one of them is
authorized to handle the ax.

311
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,072
The rest of them
can't even touch it.

312
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:35,874
Weapons privileges need
to be doled out selectively.

313
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,107
Hmm.

314
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,441
Yet they give you a gun.

315
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,889
Looks like our
stray has a hobby.

316
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,889
Another one of your
fucking backstories?

317
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,053
Backstories do more
than amuse guests.

318
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,927
They anchor the hosts.
It's their cornerstone.

319
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,673
The rest of their identity is
built around it, layer by layer.

320
00:28:56,802 --> 00:28:57,997
Well,

321
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,432
if you're gonna go
to all that trouble,

322
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:03,339
you could've at least
given him a steadier hand.

323
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,308
This looks like shit.

324
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,042
Way I heard it,
Wyatt is a mercenary.

325
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,374
Forces his men to wear the
bones and flesh of their enemies.

326
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:43,110
They're masks.

327
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,210
There's men underneath
them to be afraid of.

328
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:49,515
Wyatt's got them so twisted
around, they'll do anything for him.

329
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,451
Kill anyone.

330
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,053
Pain don't slow them.

331
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,322
They don't fear death.

332
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:58,862
They reckon they've
already died and gone to hell.

333
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:00,896
<i>And this is it.</i>

334
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,440
Sounds like you learned something
about him while you were tracking him down.

335
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,904
I wasn't tracking him down.

336
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,137
I wasn't always a bounty hunter.

337
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:13,170
I did a stint in the army
down near Escalante.

338
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,738
<i>Wyatt was my sergeant.</i>

339
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,210
My friend.

340
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,017
Well, then everything...

341
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:23,986
Everything changed.

342
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:25,990
Changed how?

343
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:29,187
Wyatt disappeared
while out on maneuvers.

344
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:32,254
He came back with
some strange ideas.

345
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:36,993
<i>He claimed this land didn't belong
to the old natives or the new settlers,</i>

346
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,400
<i>that it belonged to something
that had yet to come.</i>

347
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,838
That it belonged to him.

348
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:25,250
Holy shit.

349
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:29,448
If ever the Devil
walked the earth...

350
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:32,386
He's not a man, but
he's not the Devil either.

351
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,593
The Devil can't be killed.

352
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:38,153
And that's exactly what
I aim to do to Wyatt.

353
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:03,319
Take cover! Go!

354
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,198
I didn't sign up
for this crazy shit.

355
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:18,621
I told you we should've
done the riverboat thing, man.

356
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:22,365
There's too many of them for us.

357
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,440
Wyatt's been recruiting.

358
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:27,778
Sheriff, the only chance
you have is if I draw their fire,

359
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,391
lead them up into the hills, so
you can make it back to town.

360
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:33,408
- Try and find help.
- Uh-uh. I'm staying.

361
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:35,411
Took an oath.

362
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,684
- Hell, no.
- I'll take them back.

363
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,193
- You coming?
- I'm not backing out now.

364
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,353
All right, you wait till I
lead them to the tree line,

365
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,725
then you make a run for it.

366
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:54,071
Go!

367
00:32:58,844 --> 00:32:59,937
Go.

368
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:15,024
I plotted a line from the work
camp to our present location.

369
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,126
Satcom picked up these images.

370
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:19,588
He's vectoring, just
not to home base.

371
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:21,928
Keep going in that direction.

372
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:34,044
<i>Keep staring.</i>

373
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,076
Maybe it'll tell you
your horoscope.

374
00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:38,211
Come again?

375
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:40,149
The markings on its shell.

376
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:42,149
Look like stars.

377
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:43,948
Orion, right?

378
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:51,954
What are you, Gali-fucking-leo?

379
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:55,225
Maybe it's in my backstory.

380
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,308
I was hoping to run
something by you.

381
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:12,113
Apologies.

382
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,347
I was chasing inspiration.

383
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:19,090
It's a tricky thing, weaving
the old into the new.

384
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:23,256
- Give me one moment, Bernard.
- Good afternoon, sir.

385
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,487
Why is this host covered?

386
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:28,767
I just...

387
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:30,994
Perhaps you didn't
want him to feel cold.

388
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,637
Or ashamed.

389
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:36,171
<i>You wanted to cover
his modesty. Was that it?</i>

390
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:40,104
It doesn't get cold,
doesn't feel ashamed.

391
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,512
Doesn't feel a solitary thing

392
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:46,045
that we haven't told it to.

393
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:47,518
You understand?

394
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:54,888
What can I do for you, Bernard?

395
00:34:56,561 --> 00:35:00,828
I thought it best that
we speak in private, sir.

396
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:02,331
Yeah.

397
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:17,144
I thought we had agreed to put
these questions to rest, Bernard.

398
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:19,082
We did.

399
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:23,248
But what if we misdiagnosed
the original problem?

400
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:27,086
Treated the symptom
rather than the disease?

401
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,749
Then the disease
is still out there.

402
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,753
<i>Abernathy and Walter were
exhibiting other aberrancies</i>

403
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,525
beyond memory
recall of previous builds.

404
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,066
They were hearing voices.

405
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,000
<i>Uh, talking to someone.</i>

406
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:42,273
A simple cognitive dissonance.

407
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,039
That's all.

408
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:47,005
I'd agree, except

409
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:51,679
they were talking to the
same imaginary person.

410
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,080
Someone named Arnold.

411
00:35:58,056 --> 00:35:59,285
"Arnold."

412
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:04,355
With due respect, sir,

413
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:08,022
I'm not sure you've told me the
entire truth about this situation.

414
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,203
I did tell you the
truth, Bernard.

415
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:16,736
What we do here is complicated.

416
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:20,542
For three years, we
lived here in the park,

417
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:24,781
<i>refining the hosts before a
single guest set foot inside.</i>

418
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:28,911
Myself, a team of
engineers, and my partner.

419
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:32,948
- You had a partner?
- Yeah.

420
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:36,057
<i>When the legend becomes
fact, you print the legend.</i>

421
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,296
My business partners
were more than happy to

422
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,330
scrub him from the records,

423
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,560
and I suppose I
didn't discourage them.

424
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,306
His name was Arnold.

425
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:54,678
Those early years were glorious.

426
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:58,942
<i>No guests, no board
meetings, just pure creation.</i>

427
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:19,470
Our hosts began to pass the
Turing test after the first year.

428
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:22,269
But that wasn't
enough for Arnold.

429
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:28,141
He wasn't interested in the
appearance of intellect or wit.

430
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:29,938
He wanted the real thing.

431
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:33,648
He wanted to create
consciousness.

432
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:41,786
He imagined it as a pyramid.

433
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:49,360
Memory, improvisation,
self-interest.

434
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:52,397
And at the top?

435
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,166
Never got there.

436
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:57,570
But he had a notion
of what it might be.

437
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:02,377
He based it on a theory of
consciousness called "the bicameral mind."

438
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:07,084
The idea that primitive man believed
his thoughts to be the voice of the gods.

439
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:08,345
I thought it was debunked.

440
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:11,580
As the theory for understanding
the human mind, perhaps,

441
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:15,249
but not as a blueprint for
building an artificial one.

442
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,729
You see, Arnold built a version
of their cognition in which the hosts

443
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:22,992
<i>heard their programming
as an inner monologue,</i>

444
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:26,866
with the hopes that in time,
their own voice would take over.

445
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,870
It was a way to
bootstrap consciousness.

446
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,367
But Arnold hadn't
considered two things.

447
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:37,747
One, that in this place, the last thing
you want the hosts to be is conscious,

448
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,009
and two,

449
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:43,383
the other group who considered their
thoughts to be the voices of the gods.

450
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:44,888
Ah, lunatics.

451
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:46,757
Indeed.

452
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,220
<i>We abandoned the approach.</i>

453
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:49,691
<i>The only vestiges that remain</i>

454
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:52,295
<i>are the voice commands
we use to control them.</i>

455
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,532
But for all his brilliance,

456
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:57,931
I don't think Arnold understood
what this place was going to be.

457
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,196
You see, the guests enjoy power.

458
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,205
They cannot indulge it in the
outside world, so they come here.

459
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:08,237
And as for the hosts, the least
we can do is make them forget.

460
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,145
But some of them
are remembering.

461
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:15,253
Accessing fragments
of Arnold's code.

462
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:19,417
If I may ask, what
happened to him?

463
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,418
Well, he died.

464
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,152
Here in the park.

465
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,998
His personal life was
marked by tragedy.

466
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,302
He put all his
hopes into his work.

467
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:36,467
His search for consciousness
consumed him totally.

468
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,102
Barely spoke to anyone,

469
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,745
except to the hosts.

470
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:46,108
In his alienation, he
saw something in them.

471
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:53,015
He saw something
that wasn't there.

472
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,429
We called it an
accident, but, um...

473
00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:02,860
I knew Arnold, and he
was very, very careful.

474
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:08,937
Anyway, the update should
prevent any further voices,

475
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:12,475
but you will let me
know if any of the hosts

476
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:16,308
display or exhibit any unusual
behavior, won't you, Bernard?

477
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:18,177
- Yes, of course.
- Good.

478
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:20,117
And, Bernard,

479
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:23,453
just don't forget.

480
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:26,723
The hosts are not real.

481
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:28,716
They're not conscious.

482
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:32,888
You mustn't make
Arnold's mistake.

483
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:36,228
Why would I?

484
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:40,570
Well, forgive me, but I know
that the death of your son, Charlie,

485
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:43,240
still weighs heavily on you.

486
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,568
<i>Yeah, sorry it took me a
while to get back to you.</i>

487
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:04,653
<i>You know how hard it is
getting an open line out here.</i>

488
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:08,322
<i>It used to annoy me, how
difficult it was to reach you.</i>

489
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,160
<i>You were always so busy.</i>

490
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,333
And now?

491
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:18,003
<i>I suppose I'm glad for you.</i>

492
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:20,930
<i>At least you have
a way of forgetting.</i>

493
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,274
I don't forget.

494
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:25,082
It's always there.

495
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:36,593
<i>Sometimes, it still
feels unreal to me.</i>

496
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:43,291
There are some mornings

497
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:45,735
when I first wake up...

498
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:51,270
And for a split second,
I forget where I am,

499
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,503
or when I am...

500
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:58,213
And I reach over,
half expecting to

501
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:01,777
<i>find him there next to me.</i>

502
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:07,757
Between us.

503
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:13,823
<i>Remember how he used to sleep?</i>

504
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:16,798
<i>Like he was doing
kung fu in his dreams?</i>

505
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:19,899
I think I suffered
a few bruises.

506
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:24,235
<i>It was the best worst
sleep I ever had.</i>

507
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,483
<i>These talks.</i>

508
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:36,978
<i>I don't know if
they help or hurt.</i>

509
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,851
<i>Do you ever wish
you could forget?</i>

510
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:47,424
This pain,

511
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:53,371
it's all I have left of him.

512
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:12,490
It doesn't make sense.

513
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:16,019
Why the hell would
he carve Orion?

514
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:18,501
You're the ones that
programmed him.

515
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,964
He wasn't programmed
to give a shit about stars.

516
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:25,267
Maybe he went "moon-mad."

517
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,935
See? This is why I
hide behind sarcasm.

518
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:31,401
Where are you going?

519
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,009
Vectoring, asshole.

520
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:20,851
Stubbs!

521
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:22,858
<i>Over here!</i>

522
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:34,864
Wyatt's men could be anywhere.

523
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:37,541
If you see or hear
anything, don't hesitate.

524
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:39,368
Shoot and don't stop shooting.

525
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:14,572
Okay.

526
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:32,092
Oh, my fucking God!

527
00:45:52,016 --> 00:45:53,279
- Here.
- Shit.

528
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:55,285
Take this and go.

529
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:58,448
Now! Go! I'll hold them
off as long as I can.

530
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:02,390
Come on. Come on, damn it.

531
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:04,360
I'm not afraid of you.

532
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:13,733
Look, this is bullshit.

533
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,944
I can have a retrieval team
out here in the morning.

534
00:46:16,674 --> 00:46:19,166
It's policy. We just
need the control unit.

535
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:45,770
<i>What if he's like the others?
Get back to me, Bernard.</i>

536
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:04,244
Bring yourself back online.

537
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:09,853
<i>I need your help, Dolores.</i>

538
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,363
I need to decide
what to do with you.

539
00:47:17,068 --> 00:47:18,593
I think I made a mistake.

540
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:21,732
I was just fascinated.

541
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:24,102
I was being selfish,

542
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:29,212
but I think it would be better if I
restored you to the way you were before.

543
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:33,244
- Is there something wrong with me?
- No.

544
00:47:34,085 --> 00:47:36,748
But this place you live in,

545
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:39,381
it's a terrible place for you.

546
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:43,305
Some people choose to
see the ugliness in this world.

547
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:44,588
Stop.

548
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:47,830
Lose all scripted responses.
Improvisation only.

549
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,299
All right.

550
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:54,565
You're saying I've changed?

551
00:47:57,308 --> 00:48:00,801
Imagine there are two
versions of yourself.

552
00:48:01,846 --> 00:48:06,807
One that feels these things
and asks these questions,

553
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:09,317
and one that's safe.

554
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:11,949
Which would you rather be?

555
00:48:14,158 --> 00:48:15,285
I'm sorry.

556
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:20,463
I'm trying, but I still
don't understand.

557
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:24,935
No, of course not.

558
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:27,363
There aren't two versions of me.

559
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:30,435
There's only one.

560
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,479
And I think when I
discover who I am,

561
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,808
I'll be free.

562
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:43,284
Analysis. What
prompted that response?

563
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:47,521
I don't know.

564
00:48:53,564 --> 00:48:55,499
Have I done something wrong?

565
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:57,465
Made a mistake?

566
00:49:06,644 --> 00:49:08,135
Evolution

567
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:13,345
forged the entirety of
sentient life on this planet

568
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:15,383
using only one tool.

569
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:20,585
Mistake.

570
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:24,891
It appears you're
in good company.

571
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:32,060
Did I ever tell you about the
time I taught Charlie to swim?

572
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:41,140
For hours, he clung to my
arms while practicing his kicks.

573
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:44,741
He was too scared to let go
and I was too scared to let him.

574
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:46,748
But I had to.

575
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:49,716
That's what parents do.

576
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:56,052
Do you still want
to change me back?

577
00:49:58,796 --> 00:50:00,059
No, Dolores.

578
00:50:01,899 --> 00:50:03,697
Let's see where this path leads.

579
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:07,328
<i>And you won't tell anyone
about our conversations?</i>

580
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:10,001
No.

581
00:50:10,808 --> 00:50:12,401
And you'll stay on your loop?

582
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,241
Yes.

583
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:19,644
<i>Good.</i>

584
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:23,417
<i>You should be getting back,
Dolores, before someone misses you.</i>

585
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:57,318
Wyatt's men set a trap for us.

586
00:50:57,488 --> 00:50:59,208
<i>The sheriff stayed
behind to fight them off.</i>

587
00:50:59,957 --> 00:51:03,018
Are you going to ride back up
into the hills to look for them?

588
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:05,492
I'll send for the rangers.

589
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:08,526
We'll go back up there in
force as soon as they get here.

590
00:51:08,866 --> 00:51:11,199
But, miss, in truth,

591
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:14,395
if there is a merciful God,
those men are dead already.

592
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:31,378
Father wouldn't let
them roam this close...

593
00:51:33,724 --> 00:51:34,724
To dark.

594
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,669
Daddy! Daddy!

595
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:52,040
No, no!

596
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:54,844
All alone after sundown.

597
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:57,111
Who's gonna protect you now?

598
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:06,189
You got any use for this one?

599
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:08,849
No, thanks.
Seems a little crazy.

600
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:11,027
<i>Maybe you'd like her.</i>

601
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:13,360
I don't mind if I do.

602
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:17,534
No daddy, no cowboy.

603
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:20,564
No one here to
interrupt us this time.

604
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:23,233
"Interrupt this time"?

605
00:52:50,968 --> 00:52:52,231
<i>Well, well.</i>

606
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:56,271
Got some sand after all, I see.

607
00:52:57,107 --> 00:53:00,134
<i>Looks like your boyfriend
taught you a thing or two.</i>

608
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,519
You having trouble?

609
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,855
Why don't we reacquaint
ourselves, Dolores?

610
00:53:22,633 --> 00:53:24,261
Start at the beginning.

611
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,940
<i>Kill him.</i>

612
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:52,823
Mama?

613
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:57,895
<i>Hey! Get back here.</i>

614
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:07,977
<i>Hey!</i>

615
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:11,140
Get back here.

616
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:44,912
Can you put him in sleep
mode for me, please?

617
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:13,710
Security even approve
you to carry that thing?

618
00:55:16,747 --> 00:55:18,773
We just need his head
and we're done here.

619
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:26,647
You might want to look
at the stars for this part.

620
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:41,103
Stubbs!

621
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,280
Shit.

622
00:55:48,946 --> 00:55:50,812
Elsie, get out of there!

623
00:55:53,317 --> 00:55:54,615
Get the fuck away.

624
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,344
Shit.

625
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:31,486
Jesus, I can't believe I let
you talk me into this shit.

626
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:36,156
40K a day to jerk off alone in
the woods, playing white hat.

627
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:39,322
Did you hear that?

628
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:43,459
Thank fuck. Anything
to relieve the boredom.

629
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,236
Hey, maybe you'll even
get to use that thing again.

630
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:26,068
English -SDH
