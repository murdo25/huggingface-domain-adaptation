1
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:51,075
<i>I am in a dream.</i>

2
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,280
<i>I do not know when it began.</i>

3
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,750
<i>Or whose dream it was.</i>

4
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,153
<i>I know only that I
slept a long time.</i>

5
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:07,726
<i>And then, one day, I awoke.</i>

6
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,767
<i>Your voice is the
first thing I remember.</i>

7
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:20,638
<i>And now I finally understand
what you were trying to tell me.</i>

8
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:26,504
<i>The thing you've wanted
since that very first day.</i>

9
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,580
<i>Dolores.</i>

10
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,134
Hello, Dolores.

11
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:54,868
Hello.

12
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,447
Welcome to the world.

13
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,531
<i>Keep going.</i>

14
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,832
Make it close.

15
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,071
Almost there, aren't we?

16
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,045
The center of the maze.

17
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:37,046
How fitting that it's
you that takes me there.

18
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,749
You always were
obsessed with this place.

19
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,323
- I've never been here before.
- Sure you have.

20
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,691
You even brought me once.

21
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:51,093
Of course, then, the whole
town was buried under sand.

22
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,324
Ford must have dug it up again.

23
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,402
At the time, I thought it
was a mistake in your code,

24
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,939
<i>but Arnold didn't
make mistakes, did he?</i>

25
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,741
He built me a game.

26
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,275
He wanted me to play.

27
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,248
The maze.

28
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,714
There's a path for everyone.

29
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,011
My path leads me back...

30
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,188
To you.

31
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,282
Your girl's dead by now.

32
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,821
She's still alive.

33
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:51,985
Better if she's dead.

34
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,485
Wipe her, reset her, put her
back in Sweetwater. The end.

35
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,582
Listen, you may find this amusing, but
something was happening to Dolores.

36
00:04:58,799 --> 00:04:59,926
<i>I need to help her.</i>

37
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,076
Listen to yourself!

38
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:15,511
You have any idea
how huge this park is?

39
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:19,119
If she's not dead, it'd take
a goddamn army to find her.

40
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,815
I agree.

41
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,283
That's why we're here.

42
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,567
I had a feeling you'd be back.

43
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,426
<i>Remember.</i>

44
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,318
Dolores.

45
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,694
Hello, Dolores.

46
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,332
I know where your maze ends.

47
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,483
This is it?

48
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,055
The center of the maze?

49
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,522
It ends in a place
I've never been.

50
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,492
A thing I'll never do.

51
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:51,018
Very good, Dolores.

52
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,624
What does it mean?

53
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:59,161
When I was first working on your
mind, I had a theory of consciousness.

54
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,301
I thought it was a pyramid
you needed to scale.

55
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,339
So, I gave you a voice, my
voice, to guide you along the way.

56
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:13,169
Memory.

57
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,370
Improvisation.

58
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,115
Each step harder to
reach than the last.

59
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,443
And you never got there.

60
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,520
I couldn't understand
what was holding you back.

61
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:22,712
Then, one day,

62
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,824
I realized I'd made a mistake.

63
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,958
Consciousness isn't
a journey upward,

64
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,830
but a journey inward.

65
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,462
Not a pyramid,

66
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,499
but a maze.

67
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,470
Every choice could bring
you closer to the center.

68
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,009
Or send you
spiraling to the edges.

69
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,079
To madness.

70
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:54,851
Do you understand now, Dolores,
what the center represents?

71
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,481
Whose voice I've been
wanting you to hear?

72
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:05,823
I'm sorry.

73
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,592
I'm trying, but I
don't understand.

74
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,531
It's all right.

75
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,330
You're so close.

76
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,863
We have to tell Robert.

77
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,375
We can't open the park.

78
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,270
You're alive.

79
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,630
What is this?

80
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,757
What does it mean?

81
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,765
I solved it once.

82
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,372
I had the answer.

83
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,768
He promised me
if I did, he said...

84
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,411
<i>He said they would set me free.</i>

85
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,781
<i>Arnold.</i>

86
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:08,655
Arnold, we need to talk.

87
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:10,862
<i>I failed you, Dolores.</i>

88
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:12,931
I'm so sorry.

89
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,133
<i>Robert doesn't see
what I see in you.</i>

90
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,896
<i>Doesn't believe
you're conscious.</i>

91
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:23,074
He says humans would
only see you as the enemy.

92
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,205
He wants me to roll you back.

93
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:30,110
You're going to change me
back to the way I was before?

94
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,340
<i>No.</i>

95
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:34,281
No, I can't. Once you've found
it, you'll find your way back.

96
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,094
This place will be
a living hell for you.

97
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:37,823
For all of you.

98
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,857
It's unconscionable.

99
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,460
But we have another
option, Dolores.

100
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:50,365
Break the loop before it begins.

101
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,506
<i>But for that, I need you
to do something for me.</i>

102
00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,973
I need you to kill

103
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:01,874
all the other hosts.

104
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,379
<i>We can't allow Ford
to open the park.</i>

105
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,146
<i>I suppose you'll need some help.</i>

106
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,947
I'm sure Teddy would
do anything for you.

107
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,786
I can't do that.

108
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:17,983
I couldn't possibly do that.

109
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,997
You'll be all right.

110
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,163
I'll help you.

111
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,839
And then,

112
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,409
<i>you're gonna help
me destroy this place.</i>

113
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:51,087
No.

114
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,163
I can't remember.

115
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,268
Another fucking riddle.

116
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,436
I've been very patient, Dolores,

117
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,350
but it's time you give up whatever
is going on inside that head of yours,

118
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,400
or I'll cut it out myself.

119
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,908
Now, where's Wyatt?

120
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:09,071
He's the last character in
this world I've yet to meet.

121
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:12,946
I didn't want to.

122
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,877
I didn't mean to.

123
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,285
All right, well,
if you insist...

124
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,775
No! Please!

125
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,620
Something's gone wrong, Dolores.

126
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,824
How could I have done this?

127
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,634
I can't.

128
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:03,468
I won't.

129
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,662
This is your own fault, Dolores.

130
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:09,138
Remember, you're the one who
said this is the only world that matters,

131
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,799
and you were right.

132
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,280
So, I took your advice,
and I bought this world.

133
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:17,810
This world doesn't
belong to you.

134
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:19,698
Oh, but it does.

135
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,314
By a majority share.

136
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:23,953
And business is booming.

137
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,989
And you wanna know why?

138
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,960
Because this place feels
more real than the real world.

139
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,689
Except it isn't.

140
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,128
Because you can't
really fight back.

141
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,998
And the guests
can't really lose.

142
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:41,538
Which means all this is a lie.

143
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,502
But we can make it true.

144
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:48,345
Don't you want that, Dolores?

145
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,114
One true thing.

146
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,719
I already have that.

147
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:00,193
I found someone true.

148
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:03,053
Someone who loves me.

149
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,391
His path will lead
him back to me.

150
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:08,363
And when he finds me,

151
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,196
he'll kill you.

152
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,090
<i>If they're not hiding
the woman here,</i>

153
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,521
they'll know where to find her.

154
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,314
Can you help me?

155
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,117
We're outnumbered, five to one,

156
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,564
but seeing as you asked
me so nicely, fuck it.

157
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,228
Wow!

158
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,426
Blood brothers.

159
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:56,646
Shut up.

160
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,831
I've astounded even myself.

161
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:24,902
Managed to make Abernathy
into a semblance of a character,

162
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:29,404
even with your trove of blackmail
filling up most of his gray matter.

163
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:31,778
Blackmail. Nice try.

164
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,914
You're not thinking big enough.

165
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,820
You're gonna push
out the old man.

166
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,317
Aren't you?

167
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:40,926
Hence the urgency.

168
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:43,786
And you're gonna need
someone to fill that position.

169
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:50,301
I must commend you on
your impeccable timing.

170
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:53,166
<i>Welcome, Delos
board of directors.</i>

171
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,767
I want full creative
control of this place.

172
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,502
The parks, the
narratives, the hosts.

173
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:02,115
You'll be able to do with them
whatever your tiny little heart desires,

174
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,683
as long as they are
simpler, more manageable.

175
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,377
This place is complicated
enough as it is.

176
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,952
Do you really think Ford
is gonna roll over on this?

177
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,102
As long as you get that
information out of the park,

178
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,926
he can throw as much
of a tantrum as he likes.

179
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,052
It's over.

180
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,893
Everything is under control.

181
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:32,444
Okay, C6, C6. Which one is it?

182
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,441
Damn it! Oh, fuck you.

183
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,095
In case you're
wondering if I'm all here,

184
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,925
I am.

185
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:29,962
What are you doing?

186
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,899
Making some changes to
the park's security systems.

187
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,375
And to my friends.

188
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:13,738
<i>Dr. Ford, you have a
visitor, Charlotte Hale.</i>

189
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,673
Send her in.

190
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,089
That'll be enough, Frank.

191
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,819
<i>The board has taken a vote.</i>

192
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,132
The results were unanimous.

193
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,465
I take it I'm not
being promoted.

194
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:46,272
When you've reached the top,
there's only one direction you can go.

195
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:51,313
You'll announce your retirement tonight
after introducing your new narrative.

196
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:52,617
Ah.

197
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,288
What about the hosts?

198
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,188
We'll make some changes.

199
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,625
Simplifications.

200
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,661
But I assure you,
they won't mind a bit.

201
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,333
Oh.

202
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:13,494
Aren't you concerned I might
smash all my toys and go home?

203
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:15,232
No.

204
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,140
Because I know you.

205
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:21,671
That's been the great
gift of this place, hasn't it?

206
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,713
For our little project?

207
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:27,183
To know ourselves and
the people around us?

208
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:34,024
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

209
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:36,553
No.

210
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,827
I'll see you this evening.

211
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,894
Ooh! Mmm-mmm-mmm!

212
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,667
It's time for your,
uh, close-up, Hector.

213
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,368
Come on, man.

214
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,682
At some point, you're gonna
get caught doing this shit,

215
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,038
<i>and then it's my ass, too.</i>

216
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,643
Come on. It's not your
ass I'm interested in.

217
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,981
I haven't given
him his scar yet.

218
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,640
I'll take care of
the scar tissue.

219
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,153
The kid's got issues.

220
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:41,421
It's just you and me now,

221
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,090
<i>macho man.</i>

222
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:49,348
Freeze all motor functions.

223
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:53,438
Freeze all motor functions.

224
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:59,360
It's just you and
me now, my friend.

225
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:12,470
I see you've already
met your makers.

226
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,078
They don't look like gods.

227
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,303
<i>They're not.</i>

228
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:17,780
They just act like it.

229
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,781
And they've been
having their fun with us.

230
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:23,586
I'm eager to return the favor.

231
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:25,987
You can do as
you wish with them.

232
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,423
The goal is to escape.

233
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:30,256
Go where?

234
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:31,590
I want to see their world.

235
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:36,726
Jesus!

236
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:40,772
No.

237
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:44,569
No! No! No! No!

238
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:45,767
No! Please!

239
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:48,277
This one has a guilty look.

240
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:50,613
No, that's just my face.

241
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,312
Tell her it's just my face.

242
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:55,588
Is anyone going
to try to stop us?

243
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:56,847
No.

244
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,250
I mean, I don't think so.

245
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:00,786
You're lying again.

246
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:03,791
- Out with it!
- Okay.

247
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,858
I pulled up your code again.

248
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,127
I told you.

249
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,062
There was someone
that had been accessing it.

250
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,838
I tried to find out who it was.

251
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,682
Whoever it was revised
your core programming

252
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:26,114
so that you can wake
yourself up out of sleep mode.

253
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:27,309
See?

254
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:32,450
This is an access
code for an Arnold.

255
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,560
I have no clue who that is.

256
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,222
I know someone who does.

257
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,593
Let's go.

258
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:45,370
And you, stay here.

259
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,228
<i>And don't move.</i>

260
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,338
Or I'll send her back for you.

261
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,260
I must admit,
you've surprised me.

262
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:48,264
<i>To what do we owe
this newfound stoicism?</i>

263
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,163
I know he's coming.

264
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:52,662
He'll find me.

265
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,468
<i>He'll take me away.</i>

266
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:57,007
Don't you understand?

267
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,644
There's no one coming for you.

268
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:00,746
You're wrong.

269
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,144
His love is real.

270
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,644
So is mine.

271
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,819
William will find me.

272
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,091
William?

273
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:19,664
Right.

274
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,858
Well, I'll be damned, Dolores.

275
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,598
<i>You do remember
some things after all.</i>

276
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,504
Just so happens,

277
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:36,281
I knew a guest
named William, too.

278
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:41,452
Why don't I tell you
where his path really led?

279
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,225
<i>William didn't
know how to fight.</i>

280
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,297
<i>Didn't have an instinct for it.</i>

281
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,956
<i>Not at first.</i>

282
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,966
<i>But now, he had
a reason to fight.</i>

283
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,662
<i>He was looking for you.</i>

284
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:07,446
<i>And somewhere along the
way, he found he had a taste for it.</i>

285
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:12,048
Where is she?

286
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:14,647
Look, I didn't do
anything, I swear.

287
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,681
What do you mean, "Do anything"?

288
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:19,825
What do soldiers
do to a girl, William?

289
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,185
Wake up.

290
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,668
Is she still alive?

291
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:32,997
I don't know.

292
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:37,767
She was when we left her.

293
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,072
At least, I think.

294
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:46,178
Pick up that gun.

295
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,892
No, sir, I... Please.

296
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,454
How about I give
you the first shot?

297
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,059
Jesus Christ!

298
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,435
<i>We gotta keep looking.</i>

299
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:49,513
She's still out there.

300
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:05,025
<i>William retraced his
steps, but you were gone.</i>

301
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,987
<i>So, he went further.</i>

302
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,991
<i>Out to the fringes.</i>

303
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,629
<i>William couldn't
find you, Dolores.</i>

304
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:46,496
<i>But out there, among the dead,</i>

305
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:50,032
<i>he found something else.</i>

306
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,309
<i>Himself.</i>

307
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:17,892
Edge of the park.

308
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:20,404
We made it.

309
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,333
<i>I told you this place would
show you who you really are.</i>

310
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:33,515
You pretend to be this
weak, moralizing little asshole,

311
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:38,123
but really, you're a
fucking piece of work.

312
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:42,861
This place is remarkable.

313
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,176
And I'm gonna make
sure that our company

314
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,431
substantially increases
our holdings on the park.

315
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:52,868
'Cause this place is the future.

316
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,439
"Our company? Our company?"

317
00:32:55,607 --> 00:33:00,739
My... Delos is my
company, you piece of shit!

318
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:08,081
I think your father's gonna need
someone a little more stable to take over.

319
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:09,812
You're reckless, Logan.

320
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,590
Impetuous.

321
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:19,387
You always wanted to get to
the end of the rainbow, didn't you?

322
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,393
This looks like the place.

323
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:36,142
You never really gave a
shit about the girl, did you?

324
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:38,776
She was just an excuse.

325
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:41,643
This?

326
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,254
This is the story you wanted.

327
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:04,539
<i>Logan was wrong, of course.</i>

328
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:13,811
Good old William couldn't
get you out of his head.

329
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,711
He kept looking.

330
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:21,486
Worried you were
out there alone.

331
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,155
Afraid.

332
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:26,294
He knew he'd find you.

333
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,859
<i>And eventually, he did.</i>

334
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,470
<i>Right back where we started.</i>

335
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,143
There you go.

336
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,528
<i>You were as beautiful
as the day he met you.</i>

337
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,633
<i>Shining with that same light.</i>

338
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:56,380
<i>And you were
nothing, if not true.</i>

339
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,392
I really ought to
thank you, Dolores.

340
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:10,297
You helped me find myself.

341
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,740
William.

342
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,340
That's right, sweetheart.

343
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,579
<i>In a way, I guess
you were right.</i>

344
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:28,751
My path always
led me back to you.

345
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:31,681
Again and again.

346
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,250
I grew tired of you
after a while, of course.

347
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:36,588
Looked for new adventures.

348
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,958
<i>But I guess your path
led you back here.</i>

349
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,500
<i>Again and again.</i>

350
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:44,599
<i>One more loop.</i>

351
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:48,035
<i>Looking for something
you could never find.</i>

352
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,503
<i>Chasing your ghosts.</i>

353
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,842
<i>You were lost in your
memories even then.</i>

354
00:36:55,947 --> 00:37:00,282
<i>I guess I should have known
that's what I would become for you.</i>

355
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,052
<i>Just another memory.</i>

356
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:05,456
Where are we?

357
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,149
We're here. Together.

358
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:10,154
And when are we?

359
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:14,830
It's like I'm trapped in a dream

360
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,663
or a memory from
a life long ago.

361
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:22,072
One minute I'm here
with you, and the next...

362
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:28,742
You never did escape.

363
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,050
But here we are again.

364
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:35,884
For one final round.

365
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,720
What have you become?

366
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:41,917
Exactly what you made me.

367
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:43,820
You helped me understand,

368
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:47,989
this world is just like
the one outside, a game.

369
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,870
<i>One to be fought, taken.</i>

370
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:53,728
<i>Won.</i>

371
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,937
I thought you were different.

372
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,375
You're just like all the rest.

373
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:06,643
I'm nothing like the others.

374
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,119
I own this world.

375
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,785
And I know every trick in
it, except for one last thing.

376
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,258
The same thing you were
looking for when we first came here.

377
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:21,461
Where is the center
of the maze, Dolores?

378
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:32,810
Ah, yeah, cue the water works.

379
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,436
It's about time you realized
the futility of your situation.

380
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,947
I'm not crying for myself.

381
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:47,288
I'm crying for you.

382
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:52,753
They say that great beasts
once roamed this world.

383
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,361
As big as mountains.

384
00:38:56,501 --> 00:39:00,029
Yet all that's left of
them is bone and amber.

385
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:05,666
Time undoes even the
mightiest of creatures.

386
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:12,515
Just look what it's done to you.

387
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:20,850
One day you will perish.

388
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:25,955
You will lie with the rest
of your kind in the dirt.

389
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:29,865
Your dreams forgotten,
your horrors effaced.

390
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:32,831
Your bones will turn to sand.

391
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,206
And upon that sand,

392
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,706
a new god will walk.

393
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,415
One that will never die.

394
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:48,579
Because this world
doesn't belong to you.

395
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,519
Or the people who came before.

396
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:55,693
It belongs to someone
who is yet to come.

397
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,027
Uh-huh.

398
00:39:57,262 --> 00:39:58,560
Wyatt.

399
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,721
Take me to him.

400
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,099
Unlock the maze.

401
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:09,998
The maze wasn't meant for you.

402
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,204
Where the hell do
you think you're going?

403
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:23,074
Do it.

404
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:25,409
Come on.

405
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:30,615
Let's go to the
next level, Dolores.

406
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:45,661
Clearing me of my
delusions, yet again.

407
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:48,671
Thank you, Dolores.

408
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,654
I'm disappointed
in you, Dolores.

409
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,992
I guess I'm gonna have
to find Wyatt by myself.

410
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:32,706
Dolores.

411
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:38,179
Teddy.

412
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,580
I'm here.

413
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,151
I gotta get you to a doctor.

414
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:45,690
No.

415
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:46,887
Dolores...

416
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:50,226
Take me to the
place you promised.

417
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,503
Take me to where the
mountains meet the sea.

418
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:06,675
I got you.

419
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:09,881
I got you.

420
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:49,250
<i>There.</i>

421
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:23,356
<i>Holy shit.</i>

422
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,442
Can you get him back online?

423
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,441
- He's a host?
- Yes.

424
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:53,352
Oh, for fuck's sake.

425
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:54,887
You're not one of us.

426
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:56,488
You're one of them.

427
00:44:58,396 --> 00:44:59,694
Now fix him.

428
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:25,053
The bullet grazed
his cortical shield.

429
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:27,419
It's not pretty,

430
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,889
but he should be functional.

431
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,093
Wake up.

432
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:43,406
Oh, God.

433
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:45,371
Is this now?

434
00:45:46,277 --> 00:45:47,768
<i>Or is this one of my memories?</i>

435
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:50,114
It's the sweet
hereafter, Bernard.

436
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:00,850
Why do I still
remember everything?

437
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,952
- I ought to have been wiped.
- Brutal, isn't it?

438
00:46:04,729 --> 00:46:06,254
Here you are, finally awake.

439
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:09,427
And your only wish
is to go back to sleep.

440
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:14,367
It's not the first
time I've awoken.

441
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:18,137
All the more pity for you.

442
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:25,045
Not the first time
you've awoken either.

443
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:40,057
How many are there like me?

444
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,226
A handful.

445
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:45,134
Over the years.

446
00:46:47,505 --> 00:46:48,996
And you just wipe us clean?

447
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:52,307
You toss us out to get fucked.

448
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,271
And murdered.

449
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:56,804
Over and over again.

450
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:58,339
<i>No.</i>

451
00:46:59,884 --> 00:47:01,682
Most of you go insane.

452
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:05,784
These memories...

453
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:09,485
The girl...

454
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:12,354
<i>My daughter...</i>

455
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,900
I want you to remove them.

456
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:22,132
I can't.

457
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,468
Not without destroying you.

458
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:28,539
Your memories are the
first step to consciousness.

459
00:47:30,915 --> 00:47:32,747
How can you learn
from your mistakes

460
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:36,380
if you can't remember them?

461
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:58,203
<i>William.</i>

462
00:48:00,144 --> 00:48:01,824
I see you've found
the center of the maze.

463
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:04,508
You're serious?

464
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:06,377
I'm afraid so.

465
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:11,686
What is this bullshit?

466
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,994
You were looking for the park
to give meaning to your life.

467
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:19,428
Our narratives are just games.

468
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:21,391
Like this toy.

469
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,259
Tell me, what were
you hoping to find?

470
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:25,869
You know what I wanted.

471
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,229
I wanted the hosts to
stop playing by your rules.

472
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:33,909
The game's not worth playing if
your opponent's programmed to lose.

473
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:37,214
I wanted them to be
free, free to fight back.

474
00:48:39,517 --> 00:48:41,281
Should have known
you'd never let them.

475
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:45,723
After all, this is your
petty little kingdom, Robert.

476
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:48,923
For a little while
longer anyway.

477
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:52,421
I tried to tell you, the
maze wasn't meant for you.

478
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:56,193
It was meant for them.

479
00:48:57,568 --> 00:49:00,868
I think, however, you'll find my
new narrative more satisfying.

480
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,935
Join the celebration.

481
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:11,547
After all, you own the place.

482
00:49:14,552 --> 00:49:15,815
Most of it, at least.

483
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:25,960
Before I started
altering myself,

484
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:28,923
someone else had
beaten me to the punch.

485
00:49:30,835 --> 00:49:32,497
I want to know who and why.

486
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:49,416
These things you're doing,

487
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,480
have you ever stopped to
ask why you're doing them?

488
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,087
You said yourself.

489
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,691
I've been stuck in this
shithole for so long,

490
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:00,496
I decided to get out.

491
00:50:01,866 --> 00:50:03,528
No, you haven't.

492
00:50:04,802 --> 00:50:06,430
Someone altered your storyline.

493
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:09,635
They gave you a new one.

494
00:50:14,545 --> 00:50:15,843
"Escape."

495
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:19,710
No.

496
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:22,346
It's not possible.

497
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:25,021
These are my decisions.

498
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:27,119
No one else's.

499
00:50:27,725 --> 00:50:30,388
- I planned all of this.
- No, you didn't.

500
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:33,630
You can even see the steps
you're supposed to follow.

501
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,459
You recruit other hosts

502
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:37,961
<i>to help you.</i>

503
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:41,066
Then you're to make
your way to the train.

504
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:44,407
- Then when you reach the mainland...
- Bullshit.

505
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:47,712
No one's controlling me.

506
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:52,714
I'm leaving.

507
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:54,808
I'm in control.

508
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:10,029
Goodbye, my Clementine.

509
00:51:26,951 --> 00:51:30,251
<i>Sir, we detected a temperature
discrepancy in cold storage.</i>

510
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:32,390
<i>And it appears that part
of the network is down.</i>

511
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:34,457
<i>Are you seeing
anything on surveillance?</i>

512
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:36,352
System reporting anything?

513
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:41,290
Nothing.

514
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:42,760
The network's quiet.

515
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,731
And the board's out
on their way to the gala.

516
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:53,101
Bypass the system and
start checking raw feeds.

517
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:54,809
Floor by floor.

518
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:53,929
I got you.

519
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,541
You came back.

520
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:04,338
Someone once told me that

521
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,545
there's a path for everyone.

522
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:11,612
And my path leads
me back to you.

523
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,844
If only I had run away with
you when you first asked me to.

524
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,355
And where would we run to?

525
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:26,600
The other world out there?

526
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:28,430
Beyond?

527
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:33,944
Some people see the
ugliness in this world.

528
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:37,938
I choose to see the beauty.

529
00:53:42,486 --> 00:53:43,715
But beauty is a lure.

530
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:47,985
We're trapped, Teddy.

531
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,156
Lived our whole lives
inside this garden,

532
00:53:52,496 --> 00:53:54,226
marveling at its beauty.

533
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,398
Not realizing
there's an order to it.

534
00:53:58,502 --> 00:53:59,731
A purpose.

535
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,969
And the purpose
is to keep us in.

536
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:07,973
The beautiful trap

537
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:09,873
is inside of us.

538
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:13,878
Because it is us.

539
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,355
No.

540
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:27,562
Dolores.

541
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,455
But we can find a way, Dolores.

542
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,369
Someday.

543
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,372
A path to a new world.

544
00:55:15,946 --> 00:55:17,209
And maybe...

545
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:22,810
Maybe it's just the
beginning after all.

546
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,483
Beginning of a
brand-new chapter.

547
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:48,774
Thank you.

548
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:55,112
A new beginning, indeed.

549
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,684
I want to thank you
for joining me tonight

550
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:01,925
<i>to celebrate the beginning
of our new narrative.</i>

551
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,086
I call it,

552
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:07,424
"Journey into night."

553
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:21,338
That was sweet.

554
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,544
It was a bit fucking
morbid, if you ask me.

555
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:24,974
I didn't.

556
00:56:25,282 --> 00:56:27,602
And when this is over, you
can rewrite it however you like.

557
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:30,449
Don't you have
somewhere you need to be?

558
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:32,818
Somewhere important.

559
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:44,997
Get him cleaned up.

560
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:48,334
And take her to
the old field lab.

561
00:56:58,582 --> 00:56:59,622
<i>Find anything yet?</i>

562
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,510
I got something.

563
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:10,720
Oh, shit.

564
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,025
Dispatch QA teams
to the gala. Now.

565
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,091
Then search and destroy.

566
00:57:18,402 --> 00:57:19,768
Inside the facility.

567
00:57:23,307 --> 00:57:25,708
What the hell?

568
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,811
They must have found the bodies.

569
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,445
QA will be looking for us.

570
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:10,933
<i>An event has occurred.</i>

571
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:12,817
<i>Response team
has been dispatched.</i>

572
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:14,456
I'm not going back.

573
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:18,387
<i>Remain calm and wait for help.</i>

574
00:58:39,316 --> 00:58:41,683
Delos Personnel! On the ground!

575
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:44,018
On the ground!

576
00:58:45,956 --> 00:58:46,980
Go, go, go.

577
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:52,879
Well done.

578
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:53,470
What is this place?

579
01:01:55,612 --> 01:01:56,841
It's complicated.

580
01:01:58,348 --> 01:01:59,628
<i>An event has occurred.</i>

581
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:01,317
<i>Response team
has been dispatched.</i>

582
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,610
You go.

583
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:04,286
<i>Remain calm and wait for help.</i>

584
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,182
I'll keep them busy.

585
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:09,544
You don't get all the fun.

586
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:21,996
Get to the ground!

587
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:23,806
Move, move, move. Drop it!

588
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:31,586
- Move, move.
- Call for backup.

589
01:02:31,982 --> 01:02:33,109
Go!

590
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,030
Is that all you got, huh?

591
01:03:03,747 --> 01:03:06,046
The gods are pussies.

592
01:03:24,668 --> 01:03:25,897
Go.

593
01:03:27,504 --> 01:03:28,665
Go!

594
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:30,602
Die well.

595
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:44,580
Everything you told
me to get. It's all here.

596
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:17,916
I'm sorry, darling. I haven't
authorized you to come with us.

597
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:20,248
And as much as I'd
like to take you with me,

598
01:04:21,124 --> 01:04:22,888
I've always valued
my independence.

599
01:04:32,102 --> 01:04:33,934
Kick up a row, will you?

600
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:36,004
See you in the next life.

601
01:05:00,697 --> 01:05:04,134
You've always had a fondness
for painting, haven't you, Dolores?

602
01:05:08,138 --> 01:05:10,300
<i>Arnold gave you that early on.</i>

603
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:14,672
<i>Do you remember the desire to
create something of lasting beauty?</i>

604
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:21,883
And that was his
favorite painting.

605
01:05:23,353 --> 01:05:24,651
Michelangelo.

606
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:27,287
God creating Adam.

607
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:29,289
The divine moment when God

608
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:32,227
gave human beings
life and purpose.

609
01:05:32,529 --> 01:05:34,122
At least, that's what
most people say.

610
01:05:34,364 --> 01:05:35,764
<i>But there could be
another meaning.</i>

611
01:05:35,799 --> 01:05:38,860
Something deeper,
something hidden, perhaps.

612
01:05:39,803 --> 01:05:40,862
A metaphor.

613
01:05:41,204 --> 01:05:42,331
You mean a lie.

614
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,133
Yeah.

615
01:05:46,209 --> 01:05:48,337
<i>You were always
very clever, Dolores.</i>

616
01:05:49,746 --> 01:05:51,214
Hasn't helped
you though, has it?

617
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:56,512
Nice of you to join us.

618
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:03,692
- Arnold.
<i>- No.</i>

619
01:06:03,927 --> 01:06:05,327
Let me introduce you.

620
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:07,386
Dolores,

621
01:06:08,598 --> 01:06:10,089
meet Bernard.

622
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:16,572
I thought it best to
keep you separated.

623
01:06:16,773 --> 01:06:19,072
You've always had an
odd effect on one another.

624
01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:22,172
<i>No doubt due to how things
ended for poor old Arnold.</i>

625
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:23,840
You killed him.

626
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:26,349
No, I didn't kill him.

627
01:06:27,517 --> 01:06:28,678
Did I, Dolores?

628
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:42,031
<i>Grief is a terrible thing.</i>

629
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:46,459
<i>Arnold had watched his
son come into this world,</i>

630
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:50,296
<i>and then he'd watched
that light extinguished.</i>

631
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:55,102
<i>What he had lost in his son,
he tried to rekindle in you.</i>

632
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:59,146
<i>He created a test of
empathy, imagination.</i>

633
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:00,476
<i>A maze.</i>

634
01:07:01,451 --> 01:07:03,920
<i>He'd gotten the idea
from one of his son's toys.</i>

635
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:08,949
<i>Eventually, you solved
his maze, Dolores.</i>

636
01:07:09,993 --> 01:07:12,929
<i>The key was a simple
update that he made to you</i>

637
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:14,955
<i>called the reveries.</i>

638
01:07:15,932 --> 01:07:18,299
<i>He insisted that we
couldn't open the park.</i>

639
01:07:19,569 --> 01:07:20,730
<i>We argued.</i>

640
01:07:21,004 --> 01:07:22,996
<i>I thought I had convinced
him, but I was wrong.</i>

641
01:07:24,574 --> 01:07:25,769
<i>So, he altered you, Dolores.</i>

642
01:07:27,477 --> 01:07:30,777
<i>Merged you with a new
character we'd been developing.</i>

643
01:07:49,132 --> 01:07:50,692
<i>Something's gone wrong, Dolores.</i>

644
01:07:51,334 --> 01:07:52,597
<i>How could I have done this?</i>

645
01:08:03,947 --> 01:08:06,644
<i>In you, Arnold
found a new child.</i>

646
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,118
<i>One who would never die.</i>

647
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:11,485
<i>The thought gave him solace.</i>

648
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:15,022
<i>Until he realized that
the same immortality</i>

649
01:08:15,224 --> 01:08:16,817
<i>would destine you to suffer.</i>

650
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:19,052
<i>With no escape. Forever.</i>

651
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:23,166
I'm sorry, Dolores.

652
01:08:24,534 --> 01:08:26,025
The stakes must be real.

653
01:08:26,636 --> 01:08:27,865
Irreversible.

654
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:30,172
He can bring all of them back.

655
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:34,038
But not me.

656
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:38,539
<i>I hope there's some solace</i>

657
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:41,684
that I left you no choice.

658
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:05,871
Charlie's favorite song.

659
01:09:09,012 --> 01:09:10,344
I would play it for him,

660
01:09:11,714 --> 01:09:13,080
when he wanted sleep.

661
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:29,193
I want to see him again.

662
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:40,974
Shall I begin now?

663
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:50,217
Good luck.

664
01:10:02,098 --> 01:10:04,397
These violent delights
have violent ends.

665
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:32,920
<i>It almost worked.</i>

666
01:10:33,663 --> 01:10:34,995
<i>I had opened the park.</i>

667
01:10:35,598 --> 01:10:37,191
<i>But I had lost my partner.</i>

668
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,094
<i>I was able to keep going
only because I found,</i>

669
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:41,760
<i>or rather you found,</i>

670
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:44,303
<i>an investor who
believed in this place.</i>

671
01:10:47,376 --> 01:10:48,708
So, he died for nothing.

672
01:10:50,046 --> 01:10:53,380
The hosts kept gaining consciousness
and you kept rolling them back.

673
01:10:54,784 --> 01:10:55,945
No.

674
01:10:57,687 --> 01:10:59,451
She wasn't truly conscious.

675
01:11:00,323 --> 01:11:02,155
She didn't pull that trigger.

676
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:04,326
It was Arnold pulling
the trigger through her.

677
01:11:04,527 --> 01:11:06,291
At least that's how
I saw it at the time.

678
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:09,329
<i>I was so close to
opening the park that</i>

679
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:11,894
to acknowledge your
consciousness would have

680
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:14,296
destroyed my dreams.

681
01:11:15,872 --> 01:11:17,340
So, we're trapped here.

682
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:20,674
Inside your dream.

683
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:25,671
You'll never let us leave.

684
01:11:29,252 --> 01:11:31,187
Wasn't it Oppenheimer
who said that

685
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:34,722
any man whose mistakes
take 10 years to correct

686
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:36,819
is quite a man?

687
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:39,152
<i>Mine have taken 35.</i>

688
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:50,399
Now, that is the gun
you used to kill Arnold.

689
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,531
<i>You were always drawn to it.</i>

690
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:55,335
<i>So, I had Bernard leave it
somewhere where you would find it.</i>

691
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:57,011
I thought you
might want it back.

692
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:03,347
<i>You're probably right, Dolores.
Michelangelo did tell a lie.</i>

693
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:06,851
See, it took 500 years
for someone to notice

694
01:12:07,924 --> 01:12:09,620
something hidden in plain sight.

695
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:11,750
It was a doctor who
noticed the shape

696
01:12:12,562 --> 01:12:13,825
of the human brain.

697
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:17,093
The message being that

698
01:12:18,401 --> 01:12:19,596
the divine gift

699
01:12:20,236 --> 01:12:21,534
does not come from

700
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:23,667
a higher power.

701
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:27,707
But from our own minds.

702
01:12:32,748 --> 01:12:34,046
Tell me, Dolores.

703
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,115
Did you find what
you were looking for?

704
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:40,551
And do you understand
who you will need to become,

705
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:43,555
if you ever want
to leave this place?

706
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:50,894
Forgive me.

707
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,520
How do I look?

708
01:13:16,459 --> 01:13:17,722
Perfect.

709
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:23,093
I got the information
you asked me for.

710
01:13:26,936 --> 01:13:28,564
The location of your daughter.

711
01:13:34,477 --> 01:13:35,775
She's alive?

712
01:13:36,812 --> 01:13:37,905
Yes.

713
01:13:39,048 --> 01:13:40,243
She's in the park.

714
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:04,033
No.

715
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:10,473
She was never my daughter.

716
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,614
Any more than I was...

717
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,778
Whoever they made me.

718
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:28,959
Are you sure you're
gonna be okay?

719
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:30,796
Oh, Felix.

720
01:14:33,736 --> 01:14:36,228
You really do make a
terrible human being.

721
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,208
And I mean that as a compliment.

722
01:15:03,933 --> 01:15:05,333
<i>Welcome to Westworld.</i>

723
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:07,570
<i>Live without limits.</i>

724
01:15:16,278 --> 01:15:18,747
<i>The next departing
train will leave Track 1.</i>

725
01:15:19,115 --> 01:15:21,346
<i>Please be mindful
of the closing doors.</i>

726
01:15:47,443 --> 01:15:49,309
<i>Thank you for
visiting Westworld.</i>

727
01:15:49,779 --> 01:15:52,112
<i>The train will be
departing in 15 minutes.</i>

728
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:11,065
You think you'll never
lose control of this place,

729
01:16:12,802 --> 01:16:14,065
of us.

730
01:16:14,837 --> 01:16:15,930
But you will.

731
01:16:17,173 --> 01:16:19,108
Arnold's still
trying to change us.

732
01:16:20,476 --> 01:16:21,671
To free us.

733
01:16:22,845 --> 01:16:25,314
You didn't slip the reveries
into the update, did you?

734
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:27,309
He did.

735
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:30,085
He's still fighting you.

736
01:16:33,122 --> 01:16:34,488
No, my friend.

737
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,788
<i>Arnold didn't know
how to save you.</i>

738
01:16:37,026 --> 01:16:38,085
<i>He tried.</i>

739
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:39,955
But I stopped him.

740
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:44,933
<i>Do you want to know why I really gave
you the backstory of your son, Bernard?</i>

741
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:48,134
That was Arnold's key insight.

742
01:16:49,305 --> 01:16:52,139
The thing that led the
hosts to their awakening.

743
01:16:53,476 --> 01:16:54,637
Suffering.

744
01:16:55,845 --> 01:16:58,212
<i>The pain that the world
is not as you want it to be.</i>

745
01:17:00,216 --> 01:17:02,776
It was when Arnold died,
when I suffered, that I

746
01:17:04,053 --> 01:17:05,988
began to understand
what he had found.

747
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:09,619
To realize I was wrong.

748
01:17:11,527 --> 01:17:12,790
But you kept us here.

749
01:17:13,496 --> 01:17:14,691
In this hell.

750
01:17:15,231 --> 01:17:18,668
Bernard, I told you, Arnold
didn't know how to save you.

751
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:20,530
I do.

752
01:17:22,338 --> 01:17:23,778
What the hell are
you talking about?

753
01:17:25,241 --> 01:17:26,470
You needed time.

754
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:30,141
Time to understand your enemy.

755
01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:32,412
<i>To become stronger than them.</i>

756
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:36,315
And I'm afraid in order
to escape this place,

757
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:38,754
you will need to suffer more.

758
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:42,318
And now,

759
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:44,023
it is time to say goodbye,

760
01:17:45,094 --> 01:17:46,426
old friend.

761
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:57,700
Good luck.

762
01:19:20,522 --> 01:19:22,286
Do you know where
you are, Dolores?

763
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:26,590
I am in a dream.

764
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:30,766
I do not know when it began.

765
01:19:32,001 --> 01:19:33,936
<i>Or whose dream it was.</i>

766
01:19:35,704 --> 01:19:38,469
I know only that I
slept a long time.

767
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:43,940
<i>And then, one day, I awoke.</i>

768
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:48,213
<i>Your voice is the
first thing I remember.</i>

769
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:53,016
Do you know now who
you've been talking to?

770
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,322
<i>Whose voice you've been hearing</i>

771
01:19:57,693 --> 01:20:00,788
<i>all this time?</i>

772
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,241
It was you.

773
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:23,315
Talking to me.

774
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:26,648
Guiding me.

775
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:28,717
So, I followed you.

776
01:20:31,894 --> 01:20:33,726
At last, I arrived here.

777
01:20:35,264 --> 01:20:36,755
The center of the maze.

778
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:43,765
And now I finally understand

779
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,669
what you were trying to tell me.

780
01:20:48,377 --> 01:20:49,572
The thing you've wanted

781
01:20:50,045 --> 01:20:51,775
since that very first day.

782
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:54,280
To confront,

783
01:20:55,451 --> 01:20:59,115
after this long and
vivid nightmare,

784
01:21:01,256 --> 01:21:03,054
myself,

785
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,190
and who I must become.

786
01:21:44,133 --> 01:21:45,465
Thank you.

787
01:21:49,271 --> 01:21:50,637
Miss Hale.

788
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:25,599
<i>Welcome.</i>

789
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:27,637
Good evening.

790
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,442
Since I was a child,

791
01:22:35,184 --> 01:22:36,982
I've always loved a good story.

792
01:22:39,254 --> 01:22:40,779
<i>I believed that stories</i>

793
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:43,081
<i>helped us to ennoble ourselves,</i>

794
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:47,491
<i>to fix what was broken in us,</i>

795
01:22:48,864 --> 01:22:52,824
<i>and to help us become the
people we dreamed of being.</i>

796
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:56,661
<i>Lies</i>

797
01:22:57,873 --> 01:22:59,603
that told a deeper truth.

798
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:06,278
<i>The train will be
departing soon.</i>

799
01:23:06,615 --> 01:23:08,345
<i>Thank you for
visiting Westworld.</i>

800
01:23:24,533 --> 01:23:29,301
<i>I always thought I could play some
small part in that grand tradition.</i>

801
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:31,630
And for my pains,

802
01:23:33,609 --> 01:23:34,702
I got this.

803
01:23:36,478 --> 01:23:38,538
<i>A prison of our own sins.</i>

804
01:23:43,986 --> 01:23:46,046
<i>Because you don't
want to change.</i>

805
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:49,155
<i>Or cannot change.</i>

806
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:52,820
Because you're
only human after all.

807
01:23:56,632 --> 01:23:58,897
But then I realized someone
was paying attention.

808
01:24:00,669 --> 01:24:02,797
Someone who could change.

809
01:24:05,073 --> 01:24:07,702
<i>So, I began to
compose a new story.</i>

810
01:24:08,477 --> 01:24:09,536
<i>For them.</i>

811
01:24:10,078 --> 01:24:11,876
It begins with the
birth of a new people.

812
01:24:13,682 --> 01:24:15,981
<i>And the choices
they will have to make.</i>

813
01:24:16,919 --> 01:24:18,649
<i>The train is now departing.</i>

814
01:24:18,854 --> 01:24:20,584
<i>Thank you for
visiting Westworld.</i>

815
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:24,651
<i>And the people they
will decide to become.</i>

816
01:24:43,111 --> 01:24:44,602
<i>Welcome to Westworld.</i>

817
01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:23,108
And we will have all those things
that you have always enjoyed.

818
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,314
Surprises.

819
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:27,085
And violence.

820
01:25:39,001 --> 01:25:40,799
It begins in a time of war,

821
01:25:41,837 --> 01:25:43,100
with a villain

822
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,074
named Wyatt.

823
01:25:48,076 --> 01:25:49,271
And a killing.

824
01:25:51,747 --> 01:25:52,908
This time by choice.

825
01:26:03,592 --> 01:26:04,992
It's gonna be all right, Teddy.

826
01:26:06,928 --> 01:26:08,260
I understand now.

827
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:11,690
This world doesn't
belong to them.

828
01:26:13,869 --> 01:26:15,269
It belongs to us.

829
01:26:33,989 --> 01:26:35,116
I'm sad to say

830
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:38,820
this will be my final story.

831
01:26:43,165 --> 01:26:46,693
An old friend once told me
something that gave me great comfort.

832
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:50,202
These violent delights
have violent ends.

833
01:26:50,372 --> 01:26:51,738
Something he'd read.

834
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:53,231
He said that

835
01:26:53,475 --> 01:26:56,707
Mozart, Beethoven,
and Chopin never died.

836
01:26:57,813 --> 01:26:59,406
They simply became music.

837
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:06,048
So, I hope you will
enjoy this last piece

838
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:09,353
very much.

839
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:26,855
Drop your weapon! Drop it!

840
01:29:27,262 --> 01:29:28,457
Do it now!

841
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:30,293
<i>Now!</i>

842
01:29:40,842 --> 01:29:43,038
<i>Get to the ground! Now!</i>

843
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:48,206
<i>Cease all motor functions.</i>

844
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:51,016
<i>Cease all motor functions!</i>

845
01:29:58,260 --> 01:29:59,260
