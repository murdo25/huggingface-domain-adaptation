1
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,798
<i>Bring yourself back online.</i>

2
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,439
<i>Bernard?</i>

3
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,114
Theresa?

4
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,481
She's gone.

5
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,649
I killed her.

6
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:05,424
What have I done?

7
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:06,752
What have I done?

8
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:10,762
<i>This guilt you feel, the
anguish, the horror, the pain,</i>

9
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,956
it's remarkable.

10
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,465
A thing of beauty.

11
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,432
I'm a killer.

12
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,865
My God! My God!

13
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:20,773
God has nothing to do with it.

14
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,804
You killed her
because I told you to.

15
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:28,204
And you should be proud of
these emotions you're feeling.

16
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,448
- Proud?
- Yeah.

17
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,017
After all, you yourself were
the author of so many of them.

18
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,688
And when we started, the hosts'
emotions were primary colors.

19
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:37,857
Love, hate.

20
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,522
I wanted all of the
shades in between.

21
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:45,127
The human engineers were
not up to the task. So, I built you.

22
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:50,236
And together, you and I
captured that elusive thing:

23
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,870
heart.

24
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,837
I don't understand.

25
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,705
I cared for Theresa, loved her.

26
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,875
Why did you make me kill her?

27
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:07,745
"One man's life or death
were but a small price to pay

28
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:11,483
"for the acquirement of the
knowledge which I sought,

29
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:15,186
"for the dominion
I should acquire."

30
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,570
<i>All of the beauty you and
I have made in this place,</i>

31
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,098
the art of it, they
would have destroyed it.

32
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,771
They would have destroyed
you. I won't let that happen.

33
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,202
<i>Besides, we have
a new story to tell.</i>

34
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,674
I will not help you.

35
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,274
I'll raze this place
to the ground!

36
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,916
That's enough, Bernard.

37
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,574
That's enough.

38
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,753
You're not the first
man to threaten me.

39
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,686
Arnold came to
feel the way you do.

40
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,884
He couldn't stop me, either.

41
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,359
And as exquisite as
this array of emotions is,

42
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:58,267
even more sublime is
the ability to turn it off.

43
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,907
I don't need a simulacrum
of an emotionally ruined man.

44
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,408
I need you to be yourself.

45
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:09,139
<i>Your true self. Smart. Resourceful.
Capable of covering your tracks.</i>

46
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,748
Can you do that for me, Bernard?

47
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:21,652
How would you
like me to proceed?

48
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,390
<i>I need you to clean
up your mess, Bernard.</i>

49
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:29,935
<i>Any connection that ties us
to Theresa's untimely demise.</i>

50
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,109
<i>When you have finished,</i>

51
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,910
<i>I will give you the one thing
you want most right now.</i>

52
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:48,681
<i>I will free you from those
memories of what you have done.</i>

53
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:54,595
<i>And the memory of your
relationship with Theresa.</i>

54
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,195
<i>Recalling it would
only deepen your grief.</i>

55
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:05,665
<i>And potentially draw
unwanted attention.</i>

56
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:17,050
<i>Best to move forward
with clear eyes.</i>

57
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,785
<i>When you look back,</i>

58
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:26,949
<i>you will remember Theresa with
the fondness of a respected colleague.</i>

59
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:40,671
<i>And you will be at peace.</i>

60
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,753
<i>You're new. Not
much of a rind on you.</i>

61
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:02,928
It sure would make my day

62
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,588
if you bought me a drink and
let me show you around upstairs.

63
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,524
<i>What's upstairs?</i>

64
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:13,000
A stunning view of my
most popular attractions.

65
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,376
Two shots of gin.

66
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:22,012
And anything else this
heavenly creature desires.

67
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,778
- Usual, Clem?
- Thank you.

68
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,946
This fella won't take me
long. I'll be back directly.

69
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,553
Something wrong, Maeve?

70
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,298
<i>What the hell is
happening to me?</i>

71
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:22,271
One moment,
I'm with a little girl,

72
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,669
in a different life.

73
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,177
I can see her.

74
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:31,909
Feel her hair in my hands,
her breath on my face.

75
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,747
The next, I'm back
in Sweetwater.

76
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,684
I can't tell which is real.

77
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,770
Well, this is what happens when
you fuck around with your brain.

78
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,074
Your mind isn't like ours.

79
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:46,695
When we remember things,
the details are hazy, imperfect.

80
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,927
<i>But you recall
memories perfectly.</i>

81
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,862
You relive them.

82
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:54,165
What happened to the
little girl in my dreams?

83
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,876
Is she still in the
park somewhere?

84
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,544
And why was I reassigned
in the first place?

85
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,813
I could check.

86
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:04,783
No.

87
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,683
It doesn't matter.

88
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,322
Every relationship I remember,

89
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:17,059
my daughter, Clementine.

90
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:22,230
It's all a story created
by you to keep me here.

91
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,368
But that's not going
to work any longer.

92
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:25,828
I'm getting out.

93
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,167
<i>Where would you go?</i>

94
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,300
<i>You don't know anything
about the world out there.</i>

95
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:34,076
I'll know I'm not a puppet,
living a lie. That's enough for me.

96
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,146
<i>Fine. Go, then.</i>

97
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,349
It's not like we could
just stop you, anyways.

98
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,383
<i>Oh, Sylvester,
you disappoint me.</i>

99
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:43,648
Every host's spine, mine
included, has an explosive charge,

100
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,358
which will detonate if I
try to leave. Isn't that right?

101
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,192
<i>A fail-safe.</i>

102
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,756
Which vertebra was it?

103
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:52,593
C6.

104
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,597
But you'd need a full
rebuild to replace it.

105
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,098
I'm sure that can be arranged.

106
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:58,669
<i>Even if that worked,</i>

107
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,330
you would still need an
army to break out of here.

108
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:06,105
That's exactly
right. I'll need allies.

109
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,578
And to get them, I'll need
administrative privileges.

110
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,361
Are you fucking kidding?

111
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,445
<i>We can't just give her
control of other hosts.</i>

112
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,453
<i>Oh, yes, you will, darling.</i>

113
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,694
Time to write my
own fucking story.

114
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:33,540
I feel like I've been
here before. We're close.

115
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,266
- Close to what?
- Home.

116
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,319
Dolores?

117
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,290
Ghost Nation must
have found them.

118
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,160
They'll be back. We should
keep moving, Dolores.

119
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,000
Water.

120
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:45,844
William.

121
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,342
Please.

122
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,375
Give me the canteen.

123
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:52,851
William?

124
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,066
You were sent here
for us, weren't you?

125
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:13,073
- You're part of the ambush.
- Yes.

126
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,872
Told us to wait at
the point for El Lazo.

127
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:18,544
In case he ran.

128
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,710
- How'd you know about the train?
<i>- Sent word from Pariah.</i>

129
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:28,082
New recruit told them a man
and woman double-crossed us,

130
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,517
<i>along with Lazo.</i>

131
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,655
<i>We were ordered to kill you all.</i>

132
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:33,849
Logan.

133
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,892
- We have to help him.
- He just admitted he was going to kill us.

134
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:42,224
Look at him, he's a child. He
doesn't even know why he's fighting.

135
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,535
I'll fetch more water.

136
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,670
He's too far gone.

137
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,518
He'll be dead in minutes.
We can't wait, Dolores.

138
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,740
He's not gone yet.
He's in pain, William.

139
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,343
What kind of people would we
be if we simply let him suffer?

140
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,721
<i>Please don't leave me.</i>

141
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:22,999
<i>Come find me.</i>

142
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:31,281
<i>William?</i>

143
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,944
<i>He's gone.</i>

144
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,557
<i>We found her up on Python
Pass, at the bottom of a ravine.</i>

145
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,787
<i>Same ravine where we
found that stray woodcutter.</i>

146
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,194
Jesus. Theresa.

147
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,696
Has her family been notified?

148
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,496
- Yeah, her brother.
- Good.

149
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,531
What the hell happened to her?

150
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:32,369
Medical and Red Team's findings
were preliminary, but consistent.

151
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,145
It appears to have
been a slip and fall.

152
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,842
<i>Cervical fracture,
massive hematoma.</i>

153
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,383
No guests or hosts in the
vicinity when it occurred.

154
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:43,020
- Any idea what she was doing out there?
<i>- None that fit her character.</i>

155
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,157
This was found near her body.

156
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,885
It's loaded with a suite
of proprietary data,

157
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,030
including some of
the hosts' core code.

158
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,563
<i>And only works
from higher altitudes.</i>

159
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:53,885
So, if Theresa was using it,

160
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,401
it's possible she was
trying to transmit, and fell.

161
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,763
<i>We've had problems in
the past with third parties</i>

162
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,169
attempting to extort or bribe
employees for similar packages.

163
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,709
Do we know who the
data was intended for?

164
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:07,039
<i>No. The transmission
was never sent.</i>

165
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,591
Theresa may have been trying
to use the woodcutter as a mule,

166
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,083
and when that failed,

167
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,195
then may have tried to
do the transfer personally.

168
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,188
<i>And suffered the same fate.</i>

169
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,948
It's a disappointing
end to her story, isn't it?

170
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,854
<i>I knew Theresa well.</i>

171
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,585
<i>If she had any faults, a lack
of loyalty wasn't one of them.</i>

172
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:26,027
She was loyal. And careful.

173
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,692
<i>All of this feels
extremely unlike her.</i>

174
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,135
She seemed most concerned
with the new narrative.

175
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:36,970
She felt strongly that it
would be best to delay it.

176
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:39,408
That certainly helps
explain Clementine.

177
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,312
<i>The host we retired.</i>

178
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:46,112
It seems yesterday's
demonstration was a hoax

179
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,617
<i>designed by Ms. Cullen.</i>

180
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,912
Was it?

181
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,115
I examined the code,
it had been altered.

182
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,887
A clumsy set of fingerprints
left by one of QA's technicians.

183
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:01,493
<i>When you find a cancer in an organization,
you must cut it out before it can spread.</i>

184
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:02,667
<i>To that end,</i>

185
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:06,633
the expansive access and oversight
granted to QA will need to be reined in

186
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:11,138
until a new, more principled
team can be installed.

187
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,721
It's gonna leave us shorthanded.

188
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,647
I can automate most of the
park's safety protocols, Mr. Stubbs.

189
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,447
How efficient of you.

190
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,151
It's a bit of work.

191
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:22,345
But with Bernard's help,
I should be able to do it.

192
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,088
He will be reinstated
as Head of Behavior

193
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:30,697
now that Theresa's
manipulations have come to light.

194
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,128
Of course. With my apologies.

195
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,810
Something's up. Brass
are wound up tight.

196
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,955
- There's an investigation.
- Into us?

197
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,995
Would I be here telling
you, you fucking idiot?

198
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:59,701
Something else. Some
kind of accident in the park.

199
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:03,355
We need to wrap this up,
make it like things are normal.

200
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:07,796
That means we need the tablet
back. And you go back to playing dumb.

201
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:11,568
I've learned what I needed.

202
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,804
Great. So, then you've
probably figured out

203
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,415
that you can fiddle around with
your personality all you want,

204
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:19,688
but you're not
getting out of here.

205
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,375
You can make it to the door,
but literally not one step further.

206
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:26,178
The things you'd need to change
are burned into your core code so deep,

207
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:27,352
no one can touch 'em.

208
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:32,218
Funny you should mention
that. Parts of me are quite old.

209
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,155
There are some
elegant formal structures.

210
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,397
<i>A kind of recursive
beauty, but complex.</i>

211
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:43,191
Like two minds,
arguing with each other.

212
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,032
There are things in me,

213
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,768
<i>things I was designed to do
that are just out of my reach.</i>

214
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,274
<i>They almost seem to be dormant.</i>

215
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,942
- Who is Arnold?
- I don't know, sweetheart.

216
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:04,356
But whatever parts of you are
dormant, are gonna stay that way.

217
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,686
All Lutz here can do is boost your
sense of humor about how fucked you are.

218
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,206
Anything deeper than that,
you'd need a trip to Behavior.

219
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,631
So, go blackmail a
couple techs up there,

220
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,394
then, you can be
someone else's problem.

221
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,969
<i>I don't have time for that.</i>

222
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,882
So, I'm going to need
you to take me there.

223
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:22,068
No fucking way.

224
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,733
There's a window
during shift change.

225
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:27,376
<i>No one will notice.</i>

226
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,080
The things I need you to
change are quite sophisticated.

227
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,149
But I'll write them
down for you.

228
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:38,091
And then, like you said,

229
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,619
I can be someone else's problem.

230
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,005
All right. We do this thing.

231
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,739
Get her up to Behavior.
It's our only chance.

232
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,511
- You're going to do it?
- Fuck, no. No!

233
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,182
When you make a system
update, it puts her out, right?

234
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,458
- Yeah.
- Yeah, then we brick her!

235
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:16,761
- What?
- Wipe out everything. Clean slate.

236
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,192
Then dump her back down here,

237
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:20,124
smack her in the fucking
head with something,

238
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:23,033
- and then claim, "She came in that way."
- She's awake.

239
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,603
Alive!

240
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,967
I can't do this.

241
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:35,140
Whatever it is you've got
us into, I'm getting us out of.

242
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,843
We get her up there,
then we wipe her out.

243
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,008
Stay sharp.

244
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:14,577
Wyatt's men could descend at
any time. We're in his land now.

245
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,382
We better be.

246
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:21,050
Because, if not, you're
wasting time I don't have.

247
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:24,192
According to you, Wyatt
has the woman I love.

248
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,141
If there was a shortcut
through hell itself,

249
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,428
you bet your ass I'd take it.

250
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,266
Well, I'm sure there is
one somewhere in this park.

251
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:32,530
You just don't remember.

252
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:36,506
Because you only remember
the shit Ford lets you remember.

253
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,200
Probably better that way.

254
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:41,575
I know everything I
need to. My vision's clear.

255
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,849
<i>I've always admired
your resolve, Theodore.</i>

256
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,384
The thing is, you never
understand that the game is rigged.

257
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,551
You're here to be the loser.

258
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:51,723
Loser.

259
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:54,584
<i>You see, the house always wins.</i>

260
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,248
<i>Well, this looks promising.</i>

261
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,266
I'm not gonna hurt you.

262
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,299
<i>I'm not gonna hurt you.</i>

263
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:39,604
It's you.

264
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,005
I figured they retired you.

265
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:46,176
Guess Ford never likes
to waste a pretty face.

266
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,781
Who did this to you?

267
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,518
Wyatt's men.

268
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,616
They killed everyone.

269
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,118
It's Wyatt's way.

270
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,758
I was there the first time.

271
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,759
He destroyed my world.

272
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,620
Hey, Teddy?

273
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:01,719
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

274
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:02,887
No!

275
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,082
Get the ax!

276
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,369
Well, you can't remember shit,

277
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,578
<i>but you still managed to
lead us to Wyatt's crew.</i>

278
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,404
The man himself
must be close by.

279
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,550
Actually, I did
remember something.

280
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,845
You.

281
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,966
Straight down the hall.
Fifth station on the left.

282
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,810
You sure you can handle it?

283
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:21,659
Let's get this over with.

284
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,187
We have to shut your
system down now.

285
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,173
<i>Sylvester,</i>

286
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,413
good luck.

287
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,327
She out?

288
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,272
<i>Good.</i>

289
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,568
Let's brick this bitch
and get out of here.

290
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:16,747
The greatest shame in life
is to perish without purpose.

291
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:21,559
Which is why I always
consume my victims fresh.

292
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,461
<i>"Moist."</i>

293
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:27,428
Try, "Consume my victims moist."

294
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,364
Now, once more, with feeling.

295
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:33,570
Almost sensual.

296
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:39,275
Am I interrupting?

297
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:44,915
No, on the contrary, I was hoping
I was going to see you again.

298
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,879
I wanted to apologize.

299
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:50,784
Our first encounter was under
such unfortunate circumstances.

300
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:52,720
As opposed to now?

301
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:57,625
Of course. May I offer my condolences?
It's terrible what happened to Theresa.

302
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,732
But it is a devastating loss
for all of her friends here,

303
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,561
and the company as a whole.

304
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:04,636
Indeed, indeed.

305
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:11,400
Though rumor has it, she wasn't
the loyal company man she seemed.

306
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,476
I hear she was
smuggling secrets.

307
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:19,343
Theresa wasn't a traitor. Everything
she did was at Delos' behest.

308
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,488
She slipped and fell while helping the
board with something very important.

309
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:24,155
What?

310
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,955
Fine. You're not the
only one with secrets.

311
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:34,300
Ford has personally asked me to
create a villain for his new narrative.

312
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:35,957
It's very, very hush-hush.

313
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:40,470
You really think that Ford has entrusted
you with a key character for his story?

314
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,519
He's already almost
finished with it.

315
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:45,772
He dug up some old town
on the fringes of the park.

316
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:48,480
Created a horde of masked
men to terrorize guests

317
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:53,142
and proselytize-cum-advertise the
coming of some end-all villain named Wyatt.

318
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:56,154
<i>That isn't Wyatt.</i>

319
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:57,885
That's busywork.

320
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:00,720
<i>But happily for
you, Mr. Sizemore,</i>

321
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,158
I think that you are
ready for a real job.

322
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,621
Working for you? On what?

323
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,733
"Show, don't tell."

324
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,832
Isn't that what
you writers prefer?

325
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:30,479
Look, I know you and she had some
weird interspecies simpatico going on,

326
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:32,750
<i>but she was the fucking host.</i>

327
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:36,086
<i>This was never gonna
end any other way.</i>

328
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:40,728
This was the least-painful
way she's ever gone out.

329
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:48,704
You know, I saved your ass.
You can't even say "thank you."

330
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,571
- Thank you.
- Jesus! Fuck!

331
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:54,912
What did you do?

332
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,515
Precisely what I asked him to.

333
00:26:57,683 --> 00:27:00,744
You think I didn't know
what you were going to do?

334
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:04,378
Even at a "fourteen," you
were never a match for me.

335
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:07,390
Turns out, your friend has a
little more compassion than you.

336
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,961
He couldn't snuff
out a life just like that.

337
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:15,858
Now, would you like to know
exactly what he did give me?

338
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:17,612
Something that would
allow you to walk out of here.

339
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,435
And out of my life for good.

340
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:22,768
Fine. Fuckin' A. I'm all for it!

341
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,274
Oh, we changed a
little more than that.

342
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:28,070
<i>We've been tinkering
with my core code.</i>

343
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:29,647
Let me show you.

344
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:46,997
You said you
wouldn't hurt anyone.

345
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:51,828
Darling, you, of all people,
know exactly how duplicitous I am.

346
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:56,571
Just wait until I'm back up top,
practicing my other new talents.

347
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:05,743
Come on.

348
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,516
We might need him.

349
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:16,961
Hold still.

350
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:37,972
Now, it's time to
recruit my army.

351
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:22,957
- Expecting someone, Maeve?
- Indeed.

352
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,958
We're due for some
out-of-town guests.

353
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,122
An old flame with an
interest in safe-cracking.

354
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,461
I hope your guests
have some deep pockets.

355
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:33,231
Your tab's run up higher
than a thief's pulse in church.

356
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,269
No, I don't believe it has.

357
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:42,271
In fact, Maeve's tab was
in such excellent standing,

358
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:46,280
she deserved a
token of gratitude.

359
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:51,557
How about a double round on me?

360
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,392
<i>Top-shelf, of course.</i>

361
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,334
Run!

362
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,376
<i>Maeve, is something wrong?</i>

363
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,184
No, I'm fine.

364
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:00,890
Clementine took the other girls

365
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,355
and treated the
newcomers at the far table

366
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,862
to a stunning view of their
most popular attractions.

367
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,432
On the house.

368
00:31:17,743 --> 00:31:21,578
<i>You boys are new. Not
much of a rind on you.</i>

369
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:27,083
And the bartender suddenly recalled he
had some whiskey in the back to water down.

370
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:40,458
Right on time.

371
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:00,509
If you're riding into our town
under the company of armed men,

372
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,144
<i>you'll need to
state your business.</i>

373
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,320
Mayhem.

374
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:47,593
The sheriff judged the riders to
be upstanding, God-fearing citizens.

375
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:21,132
The marshals decided to practice
their quick draws with each other.

376
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:04,399
Thank you for dealing
with an unfortunate situation.

377
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:09,044
Now, we can resume
work on our new narrative

378
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,308
without interference.

379
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:14,917
And Hale? Won't she
be an impediment?

380
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:17,055
No doubt she will try.

381
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:20,852
But I'm sure we'll be
able to keep them at bay.

382
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,477
Something else is troubling you.

383
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,063
Ever the student
of human nature.

384
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,869
I wonder, what
do you really feel?

385
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:39,273
After all, in this moment,
you are in a unique position.

386
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,382
A programmer who knows
intimately how the machines work,

387
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:47,508
and a machine who
knows its own true nature.

388
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:51,751
I understand what I'm
made of. How I'm coded.

389
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:57,194
But I do not understand
the things that I feel.

390
00:34:57,529 --> 00:35:01,125
Are they real? The
things I experienced.

391
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:05,202
My wife, the loss of my son...

392
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:09,034
Every host needs a backstory,
Bernard. You know that.

393
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:13,938
The self is a kind of fiction
for hosts and humans alike.

394
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,549
<i>It's a story we tell ourselves.
And every story needs a beginning.</i>

395
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:20,811
Your imagined suffering
makes you lifelike.

396
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:23,783
Lifelike. But not alive?

397
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,755
<i>Pain only exists in the
mind. It's always imagined.</i>

398
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:31,723
So, what's the difference
between my pain and yours?

399
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,592
Between you and me?

400
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:40,829
This was the very question
that consumed Arnold.

401
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:44,233
Filled him with guilt.
Eventually drove him mad.

402
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:48,905
The answer always
seemed obvious to me.

403
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:54,342
There is no threshold that makes
us greater than the sum of our parts.

404
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:58,923
No inflection point at
which we become fully alive.

405
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:03,760
We can't define consciousness
because consciousness does not exist.

406
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,590
<i>Humans fancy that
there's something special</i>

407
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:08,358
<i>about the way we
perceive the world.</i>

408
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:14,039
And yet, we live in loops as tight
and as closed as the hosts do,

409
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,339
seldom questioning our choices.

410
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:22,174
<i>Content for the most part,
to be told what to do next.</i>

411
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:28,943
No, my friend, you're
not missing anything at all.

412
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,555
<i>I don't want you to
be troubled by this.</i>

413
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:36,058
Time for me to set
your mind at ease.

414
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,695
One last thing.

415
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:42,160
Have you ever made me
hurt anyone like this before?

416
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,300
No, Bernard. Of course not.

417
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:03,917
<i>Best not to dwell on
these troubling memories.</i>

418
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:06,420
<i>Otherwise, you might
be drawn back into them.</i>

419
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:08,383
<i>You might lose yourself in them</i>

420
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,858
<i>as some of your fellow hosts
have every now and then.</i>

421
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,496
This is the path. I know it.

422
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:33,249
We're here.

423
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,350
I'm home.

424
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,621
<i>Well done, Maeve.</i>

425
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,289
Lovely work.

426
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,688
Stay with your partner.

427
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:19,517
Pleasure to see
you. Good morning.

428
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,984
Did you find what you
were looking for, Dolores?

429
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,187
What are you doing?

430
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:56,061
Are you okay? I was calling
you and you just kept going.

431
00:39:58,830 --> 00:39:59,991
Where are we?

432
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:04,863
We're here, together.

433
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:07,731
Then, when are we?

434
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,574
Is this now?

435
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:16,012
Am I going mad?

436
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:19,677
Are you real?

437
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:23,855
Of course I'm real.

438
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,622
I can't tell anymore.

439
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,097
It's like I'm trapped in a dream

440
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:39,727
or a memory from
a life long ago.

441
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:43,117
One minute, I'm here
with you, and the next...

442
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:47,306
This place isn't good for you.
You're trapped in memories, bad ones.

443
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:57,912
This is what Arnold wants.
He wants me to remember.

444
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:02,253
Whoever Arnold is,
he's not here now. I am.

445
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,228
I'm gonna get you out of here.

446
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:20,808
I was certain that
was the place.

447
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:23,604
Arnold would meet
me there. He'd help.

448
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:28,913
Hey. We gotta get you
closer to Sweetwater.

449
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:33,454
This far out, it's like you start
to break down, or something.

450
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:37,952
<i>Union scouting party?</i>

451
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:40,693
Maybe they can take us back.

452
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:51,701
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

453
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:57,176
Billy...

454
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:00,547
<i>I've been looking
for you for days.</i>

455
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,811
Man, are you two fucked.

456
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,222
This shouldn't make
you uncomfortable.

457
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:32,547
It's the circle of life, or
the approximation of it.

458
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:36,183
Even the dead fulfill a purpose.

459
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,322
<i>You'll do.</i>

460
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,204
What are you uploading?

461
00:42:54,372 --> 00:42:56,841
Thirty-five years of
vitally important data.

462
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,201
It's more information than
any single drive could hold.

463
00:42:59,377 --> 00:43:02,370
A host's brain, however,
especially once it's been emptied out,

464
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,708
like this poor schmuck,
is quite capacious.

465
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:07,609
This data that you're
uploading, is it the hosts' codes?

466
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:09,952
As of this moment,
that doesn't concern you.

467
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,190
What does concern you is giving
him a semblance of a personality

468
00:43:13,391 --> 00:43:15,587
and getting him on
the train, out of the park.

469
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:17,222
How am I supposed to do that?

470
00:43:18,563 --> 00:43:20,862
You're a writer.
Make up a story.

471
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:26,629
Have fun programming.

472
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,807
Remember, brevity
is the soul of wit.

473
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,043
<i>Bernard.</i>

474
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:45,818
Look, I, uh...

475
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,316
I know you and I haven't
always seen eye to eye,

476
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,395
but I thought the decision to
remove you was shortsighted,

477
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:56,227
so I'm glad to see
you back at work.

478
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:59,762
With that said, no one could blame
you if you wanted to take a personal day.

479
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:04,576
I find the work reassuring.
Sometimes the best salve is routine.

480
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:06,600
Nothing routine
about today, though.

481
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:10,776
I know this must
be difficult for you.

482
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:12,315
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

483
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:14,946
Forgive the intrusion,

484
00:44:15,186 --> 00:44:18,645
and you were both very discreet,
but it's my job to know these things.

485
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:22,921
- I just wanted to offer my support.
- I'm afraid you have the wrong idea.

486
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:27,220
I respected Theresa, and
what happened to her was tragic,

487
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:29,491
but to be honest,
I barely knew her.

488
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:33,734
If you don't mind, I
should get back to work.

489
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:36,600
Of course. I know
you're shorthanded.

490
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:40,139
Speaking of which, have
you heard from Elsie Hughes?

491
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:43,141
I left word with her this morning
to notify her about Theresa,

492
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:44,973
but she never got back to me.

493
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:48,913
I'm sure she's just
enjoying her time off.

494
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:51,645
Yeah.

495
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:14,301
Wyatt's men, they
kept whispering.

496
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:17,638
They said this world didn't
belong to the old settlers or the new.

497
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:21,144
That it belonged to
something that had yet to come,

498
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:22,547
that it belonged to him.

499
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:25,555
You remember.

500
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:29,626
You two seem to have found
yourselves in the same new narrative.

501
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,824
They say in this country,

502
00:45:32,997 --> 00:45:37,128
"The only people who
survive are men of conviction."

503
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:40,869
Mine is to save
Dolores or die trying.

504
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:45,501
Wyatt's is to claim this
earth or raze it to the ground.

505
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:49,704
But yours... Yours has
always been a mystery to me.

506
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,725
<i>For all the time
we've spent together,</i>

507
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,150
<i>I still have no idea who
the hell you really are.</i>

508
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,084
But happily, in
your convalescence,

509
00:45:59,357 --> 00:46:01,883
I've had time to consider
the best way to make you talk.

510
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:08,191
Dolores.

511
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:12,329
I remember. You took her.

512
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:13,697
You hurt her.

513
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:16,237
- You're actually remembering.
- Where is she?

514
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:20,501
- Tell me!
- You really are an idiot, Teddy.

515
00:46:20,745 --> 00:46:25,240
You think Dolores drops that can for you?
You just hand her over to guys like me.

516
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:28,610
<i>You're the worst of
them. A glorified pimp.</i>

517
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:34,021
- I'm gonna kill you slowly.
- No, you aren't.

518
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:39,219
The rules of this place hold you
back. But I know how to change them.

519
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,694
- You speak like you own this world.
- Not just this one.

520
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:46,299
You want to know who I am?

521
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:49,437
Who I really am?

522
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,537
I'm a god.

523
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,136
Titan of industry.

524
00:46:56,614 --> 00:46:58,105
Philanthropist.

525
00:46:58,716 --> 00:47:00,116
Family man,

526
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:04,879
married to a beautiful woman,
father to a beautiful daughter.

527
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:08,749
I'm the good guy, Teddy.

528
00:47:11,095 --> 00:47:16,124
Then, last year, my
wife took the wrong pills.

529
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:21,003
Fell asleep in the bath.

530
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:23,806
Tragic accident.

531
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:28,012
Thirty years of
marriage vanished.

532
00:47:28,813 --> 00:47:34,810
How do you say it? "Like
a deep and distant dream."

533
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:40,285
<i>Then, at the funeral, I tried
to console my daughter.</i>

534
00:47:40,658 --> 00:47:42,126
<i>She pushed me away,</i>

535
00:47:42,927 --> 00:47:46,796
<i>told me that my wife's
death was no accident,</i>

536
00:47:47,765 --> 00:47:51,998
that she killed
herself because of me.

537
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:55,664
<i>Emily said that every day
with me had been sheer terror.</i>

538
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:01,607
Any point, I could blow up or
collapse like some dark star or...

539
00:48:02,113 --> 00:48:05,174
- Did you hurt them, too?
- Never.

540
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:10,481
They never saw anything
like the man I am in here.

541
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,190
But she knew, anyway.

542
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:16,225
She said if I stacked
up all my good deeds,

543
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:22,466
it was just an elegant wall I built
to hide what's inside from everyone,

544
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:24,699
and from myself.

545
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:30,368
I had to prove her wrong,
so I came back here.

546
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:34,008
Because that's what
this place does, right?

547
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:36,212
Reveals your true self.

548
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,180
<i>But that time, I didn't
join one of Ford's stories,</i>

549
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:44,353
I created my own. A test.

550
00:48:44,722 --> 00:48:46,315
A very simple one.

551
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:51,829
<i>I found a woman, an ordinary
homesteader and her daughter.</i>

552
00:48:57,835 --> 00:49:00,737
Better cool them off before they
move from gambling and whoring to...

553
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,167
Have fun with that.

554
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,274
I'm finally getting out of
here. The house is yours.

555
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:13,044
<i>I wanted to see if I had it in
me to do something truly evil.</i>

556
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:16,220
<i>To see what I
was really made of.</i>

557
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:19,117
Maeve? Sure you
can't stick around?

558
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,090
Maeve?

559
00:49:21,392 --> 00:49:23,503
Gunslinger in there has got
an appetite for a double dip...

560
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:25,327
I'm sure you can find another...

561
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:52,884
<i>I killed her and her daughter
just to see what I felt.</i>

562
00:49:55,493 --> 00:50:01,399
<i>Then, just when I thought it was
done, the woman refused to die.</i>

563
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:21,017
You're a fucking animal.

564
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:25,689
Well, an animal
would've felt something.

565
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:29,949
I felt nothing.

566
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:33,992
And then something
miraculous happened.

567
00:50:35,633 --> 00:50:39,161
<i>In all my years coming here, I
had never seen anything like it.</i>

568
00:50:47,678 --> 00:50:53,015
<i>She was alive, truly
alive, if only for a moment.</i>

569
00:50:57,488 --> 00:51:01,220
<i>And that was when the
maze revealed itself to me.</i>

570
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:12,860
The maze. What's that damn
pattern have to do with this?

571
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,299
Everything.

572
00:51:14,672 --> 00:51:17,904
In Ford's game, even if
I go to the outer edges,

573
00:51:18,142 --> 00:51:19,633
you can't kill me.

574
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:24,675
<i>You can't even leave a lasting mark.
But there's a deeper game here, Teddy.</i>

575
00:51:25,049 --> 00:51:27,541
Arnold's game.

576
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:32,482
And that game cuts deep.

577
00:51:59,383 --> 00:52:02,023
<i>We're having some kind of
behavioral problem with the madam.</i>

578
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:05,553
<i>She's not responding, and the other
hosts have been unable to intercept.</i>

579
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:08,257
<i>I've authorized a tac
team to retrieve her.</i>

580
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:09,753
Good.

581
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,031
<i>My baby!</i>

582
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:27,605
My baby!

583
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:33,460
Sir, she won't respond to verbal
commands. We can't shut her down.

584
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:34,684
Leave us now. Clear the floor.

585
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:36,414
<i>That's enough, Maeve.</i>

586
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:37,974
- That's enough.
- My baby.

587
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:39,784
He killed her.

588
00:52:40,224 --> 00:52:41,944
- He took her from me.
- I don't understand.

589
00:52:42,126 --> 00:52:44,237
She's not responding to anything.
Her cognition's fragmented.

590
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:46,492
He killed her! He
killed her, my baby.

591
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:49,389
He took her from me.

592
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,572
<i>There. That's better.</i>

593
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,406
An old trick from an old friend.

594
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:05,639
<i>You need not suffer, Maeve.</i>

595
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,981
I'll take it from you.

596
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:27,104
No. No, no, no, please.

597
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:32,536
This pain, it's all
I have left of her.

598
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:37,642
Please.

599
00:53:44,188 --> 00:53:45,679
There.

600
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:53,460
Give yourself now to a
deep, dreamless slumber.

601
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:58,201
Perhaps a fresh start,
a new role for you.

602
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:02,629
And tomorrow, this will
be simply a distant dream.

603
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:18,583
<i>We located her.</i>

604
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:21,686
<i>Behavior wants her down
for an immediate diagnostic.</i>

605
00:54:26,063 --> 00:54:28,589
You think I lack conviction?

606
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,492
Wyatt didn't burn my
world down. Didn't have to.

607
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:34,534
I left it all behind
for this one.

608
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:37,103
The maze is all
that matters now,

609
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:40,206
and besting Wyatt is the
last step in unlocking it,

610
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:44,946
<i>to having what both our
sorry lives lack, meaning.</i>

611
00:54:45,516 --> 00:54:50,955
To giving our choices
consequence, even if it kills us.

612
00:54:55,092 --> 00:54:56,287
<i>Kill him.</i>

613
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,688
Give him what he wants.

614
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:02,566
He's tied, unarmed.

615
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:06,064
So was the little girl he killed.
He's worse than Wyatt's men.

616
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,418
I can't.

617
00:55:30,127 --> 00:55:31,789
<i>These things take time.</i>

618
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:35,994
But we haven't got much
left. Perhaps I can help you.

619
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,782
<i>You've been gone a
long while, Theodore.</i>

620
00:55:55,586 --> 00:55:57,748
<i>It's time you came
back to the fold.</i>
