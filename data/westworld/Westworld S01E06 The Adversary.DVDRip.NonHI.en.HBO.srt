1
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:16,597
Hey, darling.

2
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,408
Morning, Maeve.

3
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,213
Late night talking or fucking?

4
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,688
You're only getting
paid for the latter.

5
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,284
I get paid when
they're grateful.

6
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,229
Ain't always about
what's between my legs.

7
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:43,556
Mmm.

8
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:52,231
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

9
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:53,797
Don't shoot.

10
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:57,767
<i>Newcomer.</i>

11
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,604
Looks like a rough one.

12
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:01,942
Give me a bottle.

13
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,749
You're gonna need most of
that just to scrub the filth off him.

14
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:13,089
Go find a mirror, finish
putting your face on.

15
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,929
I'll handle this one.

16
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,045
Aren't you gonna
take your clothes off?

17
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,447
I would, darling, but by the
time I got down to my knickers,

18
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,114
I suspect you'd be done anyway.

19
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:49,794
That's the spirit.

20
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:53,999
Such a big man. So big all over.

21
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:55,428
Except where it counts.

22
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:03,920
Darling, when I gave
you a turn on the house,

23
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,209
I thought you might give
me something in return.

24
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,607
Anything.

25
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,284
That's it.

26
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,218
Don't be shy.

27
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,542
Oh, shit.

28
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,757
Now then, where were we?

29
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,040
- Did you show this to anyone?
<i>- Who would I show it to?</i>

30
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,329
This wasn't some guest
with a Swiss Army knife.

31
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,696
This was done by
someone down here.

32
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,669
<i>It did occur to me
that it might be you.</i>

33
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,551
But then I remembered
that you've been here forever.

34
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:11,220
And if you were gonna sell us out,
you would have done that years ago.

35
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,906
I appreciate that.

36
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,778
So,

37
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,618
instead of our
hosts going insane,

38
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:23,018
they're being used for
industrial espionage.

39
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:28,218
Does that make this a glass
half-full or half-empty type situation?

40
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:29,419
<i>We're engineers.</i>

41
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,196
It means the glass
has been manufactured

42
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,358
to the wrong specifications.

43
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,840
Do we have any idea what
information it was transmitting?

44
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,701
Smeared all over a
rock up on Python Pass.

45
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,432
Best we could do
would be to figure out

46
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,374
who he was transmitting
the information to.

47
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,720
<i>But we'd need the exact
time that he was up there,</i>

48
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,212
and his geocache was wiped.

49
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,539
Not all of it.

50
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,743
Our friend was an early model.

51
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:53,418
The old hosts used a
legacy geopositioning system.

52
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,213
- Hmm.
- Like you said, I've been here forever.

53
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,559
The information's still there,
but the newer system can't read it.

54
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,252
Meaning we can't access it?

55
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:08,494
Meaning, in order to access it,
I'm going to need to go downstairs.

56
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:18,343
<i>Floor B82. Restricted
personnel only.</i>

57
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,605
Lowe, Bernard. I'm authorized.

58
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:42,262
Project the known data against the
legacy data and look for anomalies.

59
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,898
Start in this area.

60
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,329
Look at that. Science.

61
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,603
What time did it reach the peak?

62
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:11,986
<i>Show me where.</i>

63
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,628
Check these against
the new system.

64
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,797
These are hosts that aren't
registered with the new system?

65
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:09,714
So, if we want the canyon to
extend this far, this has to go.

66
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,715
We can distribute the population
amongst the neighboring farms,

67
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:13,979
<i>or just decommission them.</i>

68
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:17,818
No. I think we've been
disruptive enough for one day.

69
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,353
We'll end the canyon
just short of the town.

70
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:23,692
I'll find my own way back.

71
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:29,868
Carry on.

72
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,784
That look like anything to you?

73
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:56,220
Not much to say. The
maze is an old Native myth.

74
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,815
Regale me, Theodore.

75
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,630
The maze itself is
the sum of a man's life,

76
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:07,460
choices he makes,
dreams he hangs on to.

77
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,669
And there at the center,
there's a legendary man

78
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,670
who'd been killed over and
over again, countless times,

79
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,808
<i>but always clawed
his way back to life.</i>

80
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,568
<i>The man returned
for the last time</i>

81
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,737
and vanquished all his
oppressors in a tireless fury.

82
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,508
He built a house,

83
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,810
and around that house, he
built a maze so complicated,

84
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,350
only he could
navigate through it.

85
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,583
<i>I reckon he'd seen
enough of fighting.</i>

86
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,265
The goddamn soldiers closed the
border. Some kind of trouble in Pariah.

87
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,842
All right, Teddy.

88
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,847
Time for you to earn your keep.

89
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,608
How else do we
get over the border?

90
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:02,054
<i>Wyatt's got what we both want,
so that's where we have to get to.</i>

91
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,053
There's another way.

92
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,356
<i>But it's a little treacherous.</i>

93
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,620
Don't worry. Won't make
you get your hands dirty.

94
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,076
<i>"Dirty" ain't my concern.</i>

95
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,627
You do what suits you.

96
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,230
I'm going all the same.

97
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,131
And I'm gonna find Dolores.

98
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:35,649
Everything you do,

99
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:39,054
it's because the engineers
upstairs programmed you to do it.

100
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,625
You don't have a choice.

101
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,285
Nobody makes me do something
I don't want to, sweetheart.

102
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:47,400
Yeah, but it's part
of your character.

103
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,425
<i>You're hard to get.</i>

104
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:52,604
Even when you say no to the
guests, it's because you were made to.

105
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,566
And you're like
them. Not like me.

106
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:56,835
Right.

107
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,311
I can't exactly afford
to go to the park.

108
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,071
But...

109
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:09,255
Yeah, I'm human,
like the guests.

110
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:10,815
How do you know?

111
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:13,824
Because I know.

112
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,657
I was born. You were made.

113
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,634
We feel the same.

114
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,975
We are the same these
days. For the most part.

115
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,374
One big difference, though.

116
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,722
The processing power in here
is way beyond what we have.

117
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,460
- It's got one drawback, though.
- What's that?

118
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,559
You're under our control.

119
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,523
Well, their control.

120
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,803
They can change you however
they like, make you forget.

121
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,674
I... Well, I guess not you.

122
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,808
I don't understand how
you're remembering all of this,

123
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,875
or how you're
waking yourself up,

124
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,316
but everything in your
head, they put it there.

125
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:15,682
Bullshit.

126
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,055
No one knows what I'm thinking.

127
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,522
<i>I'll show you.</i>

128
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,059
Give me a sec.

129
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,191
I have to pair it with you.

130
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,495
Pair what with me?

131
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,269
You can improvise a little,

132
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:34,663
but most of what you
say was designed upstairs,

133
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:37,174
same as the rest of you.

134
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,049
This is just a cheap trick.

135
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,068
I've run a brothel for 10 years,
and if there's one thing I know,

136
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,372
it's when I'm being fucked with.

137
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,065
This can't possibly...

138
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,301
<i>I can't... can't...</i>

139
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,038
I can't...

140
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,249
Maeve?

141
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,233
Maeve?

142
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:43,842
You have a minute?

143
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,810
There's something I
need to talk to you about.

144
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:47,799
I was just about
to call for you.

145
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,010
Everything okay?

146
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:54,181
Ford knows about us.

147
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:58,247
Does it matter? We're
consenting adults.

148
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,620
<i>Consenting adults in
business departments</i>

149
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,853
that are supposed to
keep each other in check.

150
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:07,495
Our relationship will raise questions
for the board about my objectivity.

151
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,130
I've never known you to
go easy on my department.

152
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,940
This can't go on, Bernard.

153
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:20,003
However fun this little
indiscretion was, it's over.

154
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,545
We're over.

155
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,307
Give me some credit.
I can be impartial.

156
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,851
About your own team? About Ford?

157
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:34,525
You must admit his leadership
has, of late, been questionable.

158
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,020
I don't think he's the problem.

159
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,360
Respectfully, it's not your job to
diagnose park safety problems.

160
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:41,899
It's mine.

161
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:47,901
<i>So if there's nothing
else, we're done.</i>

162
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:25,110
Oh, fuck. Okay.

163
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,441
Yeah.

164
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:30,110
Fuck. Come on. Come on.

165
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,981
Oh!

166
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,549
- You said "upstairs"?
- Oh, my God.

167
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,517
Are you okay?

168
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,456
I want to see it.

169
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,192
Upstairs?

170
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,089
No.

171
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,026
No.

172
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,237
This is so stupid.

173
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,039
You son of a bitch! I'll
put a bullet in your head.

174
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,459
Where are we now?

175
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,369
Design.

176
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:04,263
Can we please go back now?

177
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,995
I don't want to get fired.

178
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,461
And you'd get sent downstairs.

179
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:10,869
Don't forget that.

180
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:14,973
<i>Welcome to Westworld.
Live without limits.</i>

181
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,486
Maeve?

182
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,501
All right, let's get you back.

183
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,569
How did you have my dreams?

184
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:24,539
Those moving
pictures. I saw myself.

185
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,042
With the little girl?

186
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:28,370
Those weren't dreams.

187
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,673
That was you in
a previous build.

188
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,785
- A previous what?
- Build.

189
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,849
You guys get
reassigned all the time.

190
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:40,415
<i>You wouldn't remember, because that
life and those memories were erased.</i>

191
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:42,960
I have been at the
Mariposa for 10 years.

192
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,023
- Before that, I was in New Orleans...
<i>- No.</i>

193
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:50,467
You've only been the madam at
the Mariposa for the last year or so.

194
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,800
<i>They don't rewrite
you completely.</i>

195
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,765
<i>I mean, they could, but
it'd be too much work.</i>

196
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,638
<i>It takes thousands of hours
to build your personalities.</i>

197
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:03,215
Usually, they just tweak you a little
bit and drop you into your new role.

198
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,822
<i>What the fuck, ding-dong?</i>

199
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:10,635
You're dressing her up now?

200
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:18,928
Is this becoming like a fucking
<i>hentai</i> thing with you now?

201
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:22,660
No, I just... I just...

202
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:25,134
You're fucking obsessed!

203
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:29,639
You know, I didn't turn you in for
your fuck-up before 'cause we're friends,

204
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,573
but that was
obviously a bad call.

205
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:35,171
I mean, next thing I know,
you're gonna be wearing her dress,

206
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,739
whispering sweet
nothings in her ear.

207
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:42,686
Fuck this. I'm telling QA.

208
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,789
I'm doing this for
your own good.

209
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:52,422
You're not going to
tell anyone anything.

210
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:53,958
Fuck!

211
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,160
You can't hurt me with
this. You can't hurt anyone.

212
00:23:58,504 --> 00:23:59,802
Can't I?

213
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:03,673
Turns out, your friend here is a
much more talented young man

214
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,276
<i>than anyone gave him credit for.</i>

215
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,846
What the fuck did you do?

216
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:10,372
Calm down, Sylvester.

217
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,479
I know all about you.

218
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:16,326
I don't need one of those things
to know what you're thinking,

219
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:20,893
because I was built to read
people just by looking at them.

220
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,725
To know what they
want before they do.

221
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:28,161
And I know that you want to fuck
me over the first chance you get.

222
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:32,134
But you shouldn't. Everyone
has something they want.

223
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,701
I could help you.

224
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,814
Or I could gut you like a trout.

225
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:40,505
But I won't need
to resort to that.

226
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:45,817
Because, despite what's in
here, we're not so different.

227
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:49,749
Are we?

228
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,826
<i>Ms. Hale is in town.</i>

229
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:06,330
Yes, I understand the
urgency. I'll do what I can.

230
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,183
<i>Terminate external connection?</i>

231
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:10,369
Yes.

232
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,464
No, you did not.

233
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,211
- Yes. Are you serious?
- It worked, I'm telling you.

234
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,532
Yes, sir?

235
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,808
All right, absolutely. Enjoy.

236
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:54,279
<i>You look well for
someone on sick leave.</i>

237
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,754
Another margarita.
Join me for a round?

238
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:02,326
Fuck you.

239
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,252
Just the one, then.

240
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:07,762
Over the last five days,

241
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,502
to make room for his narrative,
Ford displaced over 50 hosts.

242
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:16,008
It's created continuity holes in
active storylines all over the park.

243
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,035
I need you to start
plugging them.

244
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:20,504
Sorry. A man can
only take so much.

245
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,482
Creatively speaking, I'm
flaccid now. I can't get it up.

246
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:27,016
I'm sure you'll recover.

247
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:30,322
Do you have any idea

248
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:33,323
what went into those narratives
that he just demolished overnight?

249
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:35,757
Now, forget about the
months I spent writing.

250
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:39,797
I'm talking about the years of my
life squeezed down to their essence.

251
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:44,494
The raw pulp of truth, my truth,
in one transcendent narrative.

252
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,468
Is that where the
"whoroborus" came in?

253
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,941
Keep pushing me, I'll quit.

254
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,213
No, you won't.

255
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,315
You'll drink your cocktails,
make your idle threats,

256
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:01,113
and get this out of your system.

257
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,481
But don't take too long.

258
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:04,880
If Ford can't pull this off,

259
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:07,151
the board will be
looking for a replacement.

260
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:11,024
But they won't be looking here.

261
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:28,575
Fastest way to get
to Wyatt, you said.

262
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:32,011
But it doesn't look like they're
letting anyone pass here, either.

263
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:34,152
There's fewer
soldiers than Pariah.

264
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,747
<i>We shoot our way through. That
tunnel leads to the Old Territories.</i>

265
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,087
My, my, Teddy.

266
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,487
I think Robert gave you
some extra vinegar back there.

267
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,493
Maybe took away some sense, too.

268
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,590
Doesn't matter
how fast the route is,

269
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,599
if you're gonna end up
dead in the middle of it.

270
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:54,338
I need you to find Wyatt.

271
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:25,898
At ease, fellas. Keep
up the exemplary work.

272
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,301
Wyatt's handiwork.

273
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,279
<i>How can you tell?</i>

274
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,814
Straight-up killing
couldn't hold his interest,

275
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,619
like he wasn't living up to
the full measure of his calling.

276
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,748
So, he worked to
get more creative.

277
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,816
<i>It's Wyatt all
right. He's close.</i>

278
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,659
A word of advice.

279
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:53,399
Whatever your past indiscretions,
make peace with them.

280
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,501
They're only gonna get
worse the further along we go.

281
00:28:58,637 --> 00:28:59,661
Flood?

282
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,370
Fuck me. That's Teddy Flood.

283
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:07,502
You've made a mistake, soldier.

284
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:09,613
But it's not too late
for you to keep walking.

285
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:12,116
All due respect, sir, that's
a face I'll never forget.

286
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:15,118
That's the son of a bitch who
ambushed our outpost at Escalante.

287
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:19,968
You don't know a damn thing
about what went down in Escalante.

288
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:22,518
I know Wyatt didn't kill
all those men by himself,

289
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,054
and I know a thing or two about
what's going down right now.

290
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,494
You trying to get
yourself killed?

291
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,295
Making peace with
past indiscretions.

292
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,930
Go! I'll hold them off.

293
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,956
Jesus.

294
00:29:57,863 --> 00:30:00,025
What would you like?
- Water, please.

295
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,330
You look like a woman
who could use a drink.

296
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:07,501
What's your poison?

297
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:12,206
I've been here enough to know that
the park is all the poison I can handle.

298
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:16,573
Mmm. A repeat
visitor. Traveling solo?

299
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,919
<i>Purist. Getting off on
the undiluted experience.</i>

300
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:24,750
Your favorite
narrative is... Oh...

301
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,587
"The Final Burial of Salvation."

302
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:31,720
How did you know?

303
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:35,732
It's my business to read
desires and to satiate them.

304
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:40,029
Erm... I'm Lee. Lee Sizemore.

305
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:41,902
Head of Narrative.

306
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:44,771
All these fantasies come from
your twisted little mind, huh?

307
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,538
Well, the good ones do.

308
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,545
- So, tell me, Mr. Sizemore...
- Mmm.

309
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:53,315
What's your favorite ride?

310
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:56,749
Well, I write them.
I don't play them.

311
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:59,653
Oh, you want others to indulge,
but you won't do so yourself?

312
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,124
You're afraid to lose control.

313
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:10,562
Maybe... Maybe it's just a
product of my work environment.

314
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:13,766
We're not exactly in a culture
where we can just let loose.

315
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:16,651
I would've thought the head of
narrative could do whatever he wanted.

316
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:19,839
My artistic freedom
is constrained,

317
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,843
what with QA
breathing down my neck

318
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,448
and Behavior programming
the damn things to go off-script.

319
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:27,350
The robots can go off-script?

320
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:29,487
Just little gestures.

321
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,816
You know, supposedly it
makes the things more lifelike.

322
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,356
But really...

323
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:37,626
It's just a vanity project from the
megalomaniac who started this place.

324
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:41,494
Yeah, frankly, I don't know why
the suits at Delos put up with him.

325
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:47,817
Sorry. I'm afraid I'm
gonna have to cut you off.

326
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,872
Do you know who I am?

327
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:53,111
I do. Ms. Cullen told me to
find you and relay a message.

328
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:56,546
<i>"Tortured artist
only works for artists.</i>

329
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:58,844
"Sober up and get back to work."

330
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:01,277
It seems you're busy.

331
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,620
- Look me up later?
- Well, I don't even know your...

332
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,562
Fuck this job.

333
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,103
What are you working on?

334
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,973
Nothing of note.
Business as usual.

335
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,201
Keeping up appearances before
we bust this stray shit wide open?

336
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:29,848
I'm close to finding
our saboteur.

337
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:33,216
That tracking data you
gave me? It's time-stamped.

338
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,298
But once I cross-reference
it with SAT tracking,

339
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,584
we're gonna figure out who programmed
him to try to smuggle out our data.

340
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:39,757
Excellent.

341
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:41,988
Look.

342
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,190
When our corporate
overlords realize

343
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:48,595
that we have saved them
from corporate espionage,

344
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:49,967
they are going to be grateful.

345
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:54,567
And I am going to accept their
gratitude in the form of a title bump,

346
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:58,198
a room upgrade, and
unlimited Mesa Bar access.

347
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,790
Maybe I should request
Theresa's quarters.

348
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:03,745
You know the first head to
roll for all this is gonna be hers.

349
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,713
Yeah, don't be so
disappointed for her.

350
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:07,375
You reap what you sow.

351
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,252
If QA spent less time
treating us like the enemy...

352
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:13,187
That's a two-way street, Elsie.
Theresa's just trying to do her job.

353
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:14,792
Maybe she should try harder.

354
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,327
Sure seems like there's a lot of
shit slipping through the cracks.

355
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,880
Got it. Okay.

356
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:44,980
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

357
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,715
Any progress on
the inquiry I sent?

358
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:49,588
Yes, Mr. Lowe. I've got the
information you asked for.

359
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:53,493
As expected, there are neither guests
nor hosts registered in that sector.

360
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:54,928
"As expected"?

361
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:58,594
It's been designated off-limits
for future narrative development.

362
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,262
Have any techs visited
Sector 17 recently?

363
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:04,072
Checking.

364
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:05,266
No one.

365
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,804
Are you Arnold?

366
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,418
Who's Arnold?

367
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,551
And who the hell are you?

368
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:00,487
<i>Boy? Is this some
friend of yours?</i>

369
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,060
Well, you're trespassing.

370
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,490
Freeze motor functions.

371
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:09,865
- I said freeze all motor functions.
- Daddy... Don't hurt him. He's just lost.

372
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:13,335
Well, he can be lost on someone
else's property, can't you?

373
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:14,734
That's enough.

374
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:17,598
As you were.

375
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,082
They don't respond
to voice commands.

376
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:28,844
Well, they do respond to mine.

377
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,349
Who are they?

378
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:33,623
Ghosts now.

379
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,758
<i>Survivors of the wreck of time.</i>

380
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,398
- These are first-generation?
- Mmm-hmm.

381
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:43,925
Come here, boy.

382
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:51,708
Turn the other cheek.

383
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:03,046
<i>See, what our newer
designs gained in efficiency,</i>

384
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,622
they lost in grace.

385
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:09,253
How are they still
operating after all this time?

386
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:11,220
I maintain them myself.

387
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,088
That's enough, Robert.

388
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:23,806
These are the only ones left in
the park that Arnold built himself.

389
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,604
That's why I didn't have
the heart to destroy them.

390
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:29,679
That, and the obvious.

391
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,412
<i>Hello, Jock. Good boy.</i>

392
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,516
<i>I told him of a holiday
my family had taken once,</i>

393
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:40,181
<i>out on the seaside at
Pendeen in Cornwall.</i>

394
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:44,193
My brother and I
roamed the countryside.

395
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,490
It was my only happy
memory of my childhood.

396
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,431
<i>And Arnold built them as a gift.</i>

397
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:59,476
<i>He said that great artists always
hid themselves in their work.</i>

398
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:04,173
Of course, Arnold's
versions flattered the originals.

399
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:07,276
<i>I made some
adjustments over the years.</i>

400
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:12,789
Gave my father, in particular, a
few of his original characteristics.

401
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:17,821
Respectfully, sir, this
sort of thing troubles me.

402
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:20,832
Unmonitored hosts in the park?

403
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:22,559
<i>They only go
where I've let them.</i>

404
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,566
They're quite harmless,
like all our hosts.

405
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:29,702
I'm sure you can indulge me
the little connection with my past.

406
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:33,242
If you could only see
your son again, Bernard.

407
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,213
Wouldn't you want to?

408
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:43,583
I think I should
be getting back.

409
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:46,816
Yes. Talk about
this later, if you like.

410
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,495
<i>Well, Robert.</i>

411
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:55,496
Tell me all about your day.

412
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:10,045
Keep your eye on Pariah. We're
running close to capacity tonight.

413
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,218
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

414
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:17,445
Looks like acid
rain on Sweetwater!

415
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:21,752
<i>Fuck Ford and his
new fucking narrative!</i>

416
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,589
Fuck this stupid fucking map!

417
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:28,894
Fuck that teetotaling
Danish bitch.

418
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:32,066
Are you filing a
complaint, Mr. Sizemore?

419
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:40,470
I am declaring that this park is my stage,
and I shall do with it what I please.

420
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:43,205
Well, I suppose now is
as good a time as any.

421
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,748
Lee Sizemore, this
is Charlotte Hale,

422
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:49,316
the Executive
Director of our board.

423
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:53,982
She's here on behalf of Delos to oversee
certain transitions in our administration.

424
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:01,826
We've met.

425
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,601
Oh...

426
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:11,572
<i>Access host resources logs.</i>

427
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:14,107
How many first-generation
hosts are there?

428
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:15,611
<i>Eighty-two.</i>

429
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,113
And how many of those
were designed by Arnold?

430
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,183
<i>Forty-seven.</i>

431
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,109
List the names, alphabetically,

432
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:24,950
of all first-generation
hosts still in rotation.

433
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,701
Be smart about this, fellas.

434
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:50,013
<i>I understand the visceral
pleasure of revenge more than most,</i>

435
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,273
but I'm prepared
to do business here.

436
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:56,383
<i>This man is very valuable
to me, alive and well.</i>

437
00:40:56,554 --> 00:41:00,150
If you don't quiet down, I'm
liable to add you to the herd,

438
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,692
along with your
buddy Flood here.

439
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:08,799
<i>You're a traitorous son of a bitch
and a coldhearted killer, Flood.</i>

440
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:39,892
You're right. I am a killer.

441
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,621
Grab a horse! Let's
get the fuck out of here!

442
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:05,522
They'll just follow us.

443
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,091
You think you know someone.

444
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:52,494
You don't know me at all.

445
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,508
<i>Let's get our horses
and gear and move on.</i>

446
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:17,421
- Elsie.
- I identified the satellite.

447
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,972
- It's one of ours.
<i>- What?</i>

448
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:20,828
It's a fucking Delos satellite.

449
00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:23,066
Whatever we're on
to is some heavy shit.

450
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:25,245
Oh, get this, that bicameral
system you told me about?

451
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,847
I think that's what they
used to hack the woodcutter.

452
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:28,669
<i>The voices our hosts
have been hearing?</i>

453
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,775
<i>I think someone's been
broadcasting to them.</i>

454
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,501
We abandoned that
system decades ago.

455
00:43:32,677 --> 00:43:34,455
Yeah, well, there are still
relays out there in the park,

456
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:36,457
- and it looks like someone turned one on.
<i>- Where?</i>

457
00:43:36,481 --> 00:43:38,780
An abandoned
theater in Sector 3.

458
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,711
I'm gonna go find the transmitter
and figure out who else accessed it.

459
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:43,617
<i>This is so fucked.</i>

460
00:43:44,055 --> 00:43:46,183
- You alone?
- Yeah. I'll keep you posted.

461
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:47,723
<i>Elsie, be...</i>

462
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,327
<i>Are you lost?</i>

463
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,194
On the contrary.

464
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:02,204
I thought we could
play catch with Jock.

465
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:04,473
Did you bring him?

466
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:09,473
Where is he, boy?

467
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:36,164
Okay.

468
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:40,430
I am an evil genius
hiding a relay.

469
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:43,101
Where the fuck do I hide it?

470
00:45:45,643 --> 00:45:46,838
Hmm.

471
00:46:23,681 --> 00:46:24,944
Fuck yes!

472
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:27,045
Now let's see what
we can get out of you.

473
00:46:29,487 --> 00:46:31,012
Access previous users.

474
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,287
Okay.

475
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:11,658
I thought I was clear
about these late-night visits.

476
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,195
That's not why I'm here.

477
00:47:14,732 --> 00:47:18,499
Earlier today, I found
some anomalies in the park.

478
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:22,364
Regardless of what's happening
between us, we need to talk.

479
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:35,548
This has to do with the stray?

480
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:37,546
That's where it started.

481
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:39,586
But then I stumbled
onto something.

482
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:42,055
Something I think
you should know about.

483
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:46,692
I've always trusted Ford.

484
00:47:47,732 --> 00:47:49,701
He's a mentor and a friend.

485
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,064
But I'm beginning to think
you have reason for concern.

486
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:56,639
There's something going on here.
Something with his old partner, Arnold.

487
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,370
- Not now, Elsie.
- Don't hang up.

488
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,709
I hit paydirt.

489
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,108
I found the person who
was smuggling out our data.

490
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:09,053
<i>It was Theresa, Bernard.</i>

491
00:48:12,323 --> 00:48:13,621
<i>But she's not our only problem.</i>

492
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:15,751
There is something
much bigger going on here.

493
00:48:15,793 --> 00:48:17,433
<i>I'm gonna have to call you back.</i>

494
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,563
So, this is me?

495
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:30,799
<i>It's your codebase. All the
things that make you, you.</i>

496
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:34,303
What are these?

497
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:36,744
Your attribute matrix.

498
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:39,907
It's your personality
on a 20-point scale.

499
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:41,950
Like, coordination?

500
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:45,954
You got a five, you're clumsy as
hell. But a 15 means you're an athlete.

501
00:48:46,157 --> 00:48:47,819
What other attributes are there?

502
00:48:47,992 --> 00:48:49,153
<i>Lots.</i>

503
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:54,792
Everything. Empathy,
candor, charm.

504
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:56,595
<i>You've got an 18 for charm.</i>

505
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,429
Don't act so surprised.

506
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:03,704
Then there's courage,
loyalty. Both high.

507
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:04,933
<i>What's this one?</i>

508
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:07,475
"Bulk apperception"?

509
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:09,443
Basically, overall intelligence.

510
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:10,637
Fourteen?

511
00:49:10,815 --> 00:49:12,511
Fourteen's as high
as they let any host go.

512
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:15,482
You're in a management
position. They want you to be smart.

513
00:49:15,653 --> 00:49:16,677
But not too smart.

514
00:49:16,854 --> 00:49:20,791
You run a whorehouse.
Not a orbital-launch facility.

515
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,290
Fine.

516
00:49:23,494 --> 00:49:24,694
I'd like to make some changes.

517
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:26,489
<i>We can't do that.</i>

518
00:49:31,836 --> 00:49:34,738
You'd need a Behavior login.

519
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:41,672
And even then, any changes we
make would just get auto-flagged. So...

520
00:49:41,846 --> 00:49:43,576
That's not what your
friend here tells me.

521
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,407
<i>He says you can do exactly that.</i>

522
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:48,314
<i>Activate hosts and
then erase their memory.</i>

523
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,216
<i>All without anyone knowing.</i>

524
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:53,322
Took me all of five
minutes to understand why.

525
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:55,919
Lot of lonely young
men down here,

526
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:58,592
supposed to keep their
hands off the merchandise.

527
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:04,328
Creates something of an opening
that I'm sure you were eager to fill.

528
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,765
That's all right, darling.
I'm an entrepreneur myself.

529
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,940
I'll forego my cut in
exchange for some alterations.

530
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:16,206
<i>Hmm?</i>

531
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:50,410
<i>- Hey.</i>
- What did you find?

532
00:50:50,581 --> 00:50:54,541
Okay, so Theresa was using
the old bicameral control system

533
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,653
to reprogram the woodcutter.

534
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:57,947
But she's not the only one.

535
00:50:58,656 --> 00:51:02,787
<i>Someone else has been using the
system, for weeks, to re-task hosts.</i>

536
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,757
- Which hosts?
<i>- Uh, I don't know. Several of them.</i>

537
00:51:05,963 --> 00:51:07,488
It had to have been
the older models.

538
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:12,102
The newer ones don't have receivers.
But these modifications, they are serious.

539
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:13,760
Changing loops, breaking loops.

540
00:51:13,938 --> 00:51:16,338
<i>Some of these changes are to
their prime directives, Bernard.</i>

541
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:20,104
They could lie to us, maybe
even hurt us or the guests.

542
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:22,269
- Who issued the modifications?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

543
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:24,074
<i>The best I can tell? Uh...</i>

544
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:27,284
- Arnold.
- He's dead.

545
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:29,971
<i>Yeah, well, he's a pretty fucking
prolific coder for a dead guy.</i>

546
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:31,765
Whatever argument
he was having with Ford,

547
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:33,733
it doesn't seem like he
was done making his point.

548
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,797
<i>I'm gonna transfer all the
data and bring it to you.</i>

549
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,155
You need to see this.

550
00:51:37,328 --> 00:51:39,263
<i>- I'll be in my office.</i>
- Okay.

551
00:51:46,804 --> 00:51:50,536
I don't want you to worry
about Jock. I'll fix him.

552
00:51:50,975 --> 00:51:53,968
But I need you to tell
me what happened to it.

553
00:51:54,345 --> 00:51:58,180
It saw a rabbit and it
ran. I found it like that.

554
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:00,974
Analysis.

555
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:06,248
Are you lying to me, boy?

556
00:52:07,758 --> 00:52:08,782
Yes.

557
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:12,923
Tell me what really
happened to it.

558
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:15,626
I killed it.

559
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,495
Why?

560
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:18,992
I don't know.

561
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:20,535
<i>That's not good enough, Robert.</i>

562
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:22,935
Tell me what happened.

563
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:27,041
It caught the
rabbit and killed it,

564
00:52:28,112 --> 00:52:29,512
and then

565
00:52:30,948 --> 00:52:33,941
someone told me to
put it out of its misery.

566
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,010
Who told you?

567
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:38,680
A voice.

568
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:41,925
Whose voice?

569
00:52:42,593 --> 00:52:43,788
Arnold.

570
00:52:44,695 --> 00:52:48,427
He told me it was a
killer, but it wasn't its fault.

571
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:50,033
It was made that way.

572
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:52,200
And I could help it.

573
00:52:54,204 --> 00:52:55,263
"Help it"?

574
00:53:00,978 --> 00:53:04,540
If it was dead, it couldn't
hurt anything anymore.

575
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,858
What the fuck?

576
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:28,567
Oh, shit.

577
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,709
Hello?

578
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:46,648
Bernard?

579
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:51,992
Hello?

580
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:58,562
Arnold?

581
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:03,835
I'm in.

582
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:06,671
You're up.

583
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:09,641
Loyalty.

584
00:54:11,315 --> 00:54:13,716
Mine's been taken advantage
of, wouldn't you say?

585
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,549
<i>Let's lower that a tad.</i>

586
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:16,719
<i>And pain.</i>

587
00:54:16,887 --> 00:54:20,085
I'd prefer it sting less next
time I want one of these chats.

588
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:24,253
Wait. What does this mean?

589
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:26,761
Some of her attributes
have already been changed.

590
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:30,396
- Paranoia, self-preservation...
- Fuck!

591
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:34,001
Someone's already been
altering her in an unlogged session.

592
00:54:34,171 --> 00:54:36,936
Someone with a fuck-ton
more privileges than us.

593
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,107
What does that mean?

594
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,919
Don't know what it
means for you, sweetheart,

595
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,223
but I know what it means for me.

596
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:42,311
I am done with this.

597
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:44,519
So, you're done with
your little side income?

598
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:46,173
<i>Probably your job, too.</i>

599
00:54:46,517 --> 00:54:48,452
Seeing as you have
ambitions in my line of work,

600
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:51,316
<i>let me tell you what
I tell my new girls.</i>

601
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:54,854
Never start something
you're not willing to finish.

602
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:58,128
And if you're getting
fucked either way,

603
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:02,323
go with the lucrative
version, sweetheart.

604
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:10,540
Now, last but not
least, what was it?

605
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:13,304
Bulk apperception?

606
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:19,309
Let's take that all the
way to the top, please.

607
00:55:57,654 --> 00:56:01,921
Dear boys, we're going to
have some fun, aren't we?

608
00:57:11,328 --> 00:57:12,328
